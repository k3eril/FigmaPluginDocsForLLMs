## Guide
Welcome to the Plugin API!

Plugins are programs or applications created by the Community that extend the functionality of Figma's editors. Plugins run in files and perform one or more actions. Users and organizations take advantage of plugins to customize their experience and create more efficient workflows.

Plugins are created using two common languages of web development: JavaScript and HTML. You’ll need an understanding of these languages to develop plugins. You’ll write the functionality of your plugins in **JavaScript** and build your user interface (UI) using **HTML**. **Explore required knowledge →**

Plugins interact with Figma's editors using the dedicated **Plugin API**. They can also leverage the external web APIs available in most modern browsers. You can build plugins that run immediately when invoked by the user, or that require users to input information via custom UI. **Explore how plugins are run →**

The API reference and this accompanying documentation has the information you need to build plugins. To ask questions, give feedback, or connect with other plugin developers: **Join our community-driven Discord server →**

Our quickstart guide takes you through the process of setting up your environment and running a sample plugin. **Get started with the Plugin API →**

#### Plugin API access

The Plugin API supports both **read** and **write** access to Figma's editors, allowing developers to view, create, and modify the contents of files. You can access most of the plugin API through the **figma** global object.

Plugins interact with, first and foremost, the content of files. That's anything that exists in the layers panel and any properties associated with those layers in the properties panel. Plugins can view and modify aspects of these layers (or nodes), like the color, position, hierarchy, text, etc.

Figma files are loaded dynamically. This means that pages are only loaded by the editor as needed (for example, when a user navigates to a page). Plugins must use asynchronous APIs to access parts of the file that are outside of the currently-viewed page.

There are some limitations to what plugins can access:

- Styles and components from any team or organization libraries. The Plugin API can only access styles, components, and instances that are currently in the file, or have been imported into the file via a function like `import Component By Key Async()`.
- External fonts or web fonts accessed via a URL. Plugins can only access fonts that are accessible in the editor, which includes Figma's default fonts, shared organization fonts, or fonts stored locally on your computer. The Plugin API can only access editor fonts that have been loaded via `load Font Async()`. This doesn't apply to fonts that you use in your plugin's UI.
- Other file metadata like the file's team or location, permissions, or any comments associated with that file. The includes the version history of that file. You can get read access to these aspects of a file via Figma's REST API.

Plugins can behave differently depending on what the user is doing, such as whether they're in Figma Design Mode, Dev Mode, FigJam, Figma Slides, or Figma Buzz. Plugins running in Dev Mode have certain differences that are important to understand. Learn more in our **Working in Dev Mode →** guide.

**Document structure**

Every file in Figma consists of a tree of nodes, and at the root of every file is a DocumentNode. The DocumentNode is how you access and explore the contents of a file.

In a Figma design or FigJam file, every DocumentNode will have PageNodes that represent each page in that Figma file. In the case of Figma Slides or Figma Buzz, there is only one PageNode. There is only one DocumentNode per browser tab and each of its children are PageNodes. Because Figma files are loaded dynamically, not all PageNodes are immediately loaded and available to a plugin. Developers can use the Plugin API to load and traverse additional PageNodes as needed.

The **DocumentNode** can have any number of child nodes. Each subtree that stems from the DocumentNode represents a layer or object on the canvas. There are specific nodes or classes for different types of layers in Figma — like frames, components, vectors, and rectangles.

Nodes have a number of properties associated with them. Some of these are **global properties**, that exist on every node, whereas other properties will be specific to the type of node.

You can create plugins for a specific editor type, for multiple editors, or build plugins that perform different actions in different editors. While some node types can only be created in a specific file or editor type, you will generally be able to read and modify most nodes, regardless of the editor type, unless your plugin is running in Dev Mode. **Working in Dev Mode guide →**

**Asynchronous**

The Plugin API is designed to be used asynchronously, and Figma encourages plugin developers to utilize the asynchronous methods provided by the Plugin API. A number of critical operations for Figma plugins, like loading pages and working with fonts and images, are asynchronous. **Asynchronous Tasks →**

**Browser based**

Figma is predominantly browser-based software, which means it can be run on all full desktop operating systems (MacOS, Windows, Linux, etc), as well as Chrome OS .

Like Figma, plugins are powered by web technologies. Part of the Plugin API runs in an `<iframe>`, which means you can also access browser APIs. This includes making network requests, opening local files, and using functionality like `<canvas>`, WebGL, and WebAssembly, etc. **How Plugins Run →**

#### User actions

Plugins run in files and perform one or more user actions. These user actions are usually short-lived and must be initiated by the user.

- Users can only run one plugin and one action at a time.
- It’s not possible to build plugins that run in the background.

You can choose whether your plugin runs immediately, or if users can enter in parameters.

**Plugin UI** A plugin can also open a modal as an `<iframe>` and write HTML, CSS and JavaScript inside that `<iframe>`. You're free to create any UI you want inside that modal. **Create a user interface →**

Being able to pull from a library of components that match Figma's design system can significantly speed up plugin development and helps you create a UI that's mirrors Figma's own UI. While we don't provide these components as part of the core Figma Plugin API, Figma employee and plugin developer Tom Lowry has put together a library of React components which you can use to build the UI of your plugin. **Open the Git Hub repo →**

**Plugin parameters** Developers can create plugins with parameters that allow plugins to accept input from users via the quick actions menu.

Adding parameters means that in many cases you don't need to build a custom UI. It also provides a streamlined experience for users of the plugin, who can run a plugin directly from the quick actions menu using their keyboard.

**Relaunch plugins** When building a plugin, you have the option to create buttons in Figma's UI that allows users to relaunch your plugin. This makes it easier to run a plugin multiple times and allows collaborators to relaunch the plugin from the same file. You can do this using the `set Relaunch Data()` function.

manifest.json

```
"relaunchButtons": [ {"command": "edit", "name": "Edit shape"}, {"command": "open", "name": "Open Shaper", "multipleSelection": true} ]
```

In Figma design files, the relaunch button will appear in the **Properties** panel. In Dev Mode, relaunch buttons appear in the Inspect panel.

In FigJam files, the relaunch button appears in the properties menu for a node. Relaunch buttons are not available on page or document nodes in FigJam.

Multiple relaunch buttons can be added to the same node. If multiple relaunch buttons from the same plugin are added to the same node, they are grouped together into one button with submenus. The order of buttons is determined by the order of the elements in the manifest's `relaunchButtons` array. Learn more in the plugin manifest documentation →

#### Plugin management

**Support**

Figma does not provide support for third-party applications. As the plugin's developer, it's your responsibility to assist your plugin's users with technical issues. You need to add a **Support contact** when you submit your plugin for approval. This can be an email address users can contact, or a link to a website or help center. **Manage plugins as a developer →**

**Versioning**

Once Figma approves your plugin, you don't need to submit your plugin for further review. This means you can publish any updates immediately. You'll be able to added a detailed description of any changes or updates in the plugin's **Version history**. You’ll also be able to update the plugin’s security disclosure form if you’ve changed your plugin’s data practices. When you publish an update, Figma will update the plugin for every user. It's not possible for users to revert to a previous version of the plugin. If you need to roll back any changes, you can republish an earlier version of the plugin.

**Analytics**

Figma doesn't currently provide any analytics or reporting around plugin usage or error/crash reporting. We recommend using your own analytics or crash reporting service to monitor your plugins performance. Figma will send plugin developers a notification each week about any engagement they've gotten from users in the Figma Community.

### Prerequisites

Figma plugins are lightweight web applications that extend the functionality of Figma’s products. Plugins are written in **JavaScript** and their UI is created with **HTML**.

The Figma Plugin API is intended to be easy to use. We do our best to abstract away the complexities of design tools and provide quality-of-life improvements such as a linter, TypeScript type definitions, and helper functions. However, at least some basic experience with JavaScript and HTML are necessary to build Figma plugins.

If you have no prior experience in programming or web development, there are many free education resources out there that can help you. Here are just a few of the popular ones:

- The Odin Project
- Codecademy: Web Development
- Khan Academy: Intro to JS

In addition, many of the tools used in modern web development will be useful for building more complex plugins. You don't need to learn these tools before starting to write plugins, but they will come in handy eventually. We opted to build on top of the most popular open-source tools in the web development community rather than to roll out our own proprietary solutions. Here are some examples of things you might end up using:

- An integrated development environment (IDE) such as VS Code, Eclipse IDE, or Intelli J IDEA: As a developer, IDEs can be a useful way to work across multiple files or sources and often provide extensions that make life easier. JavaScript and HTML are well-supported languages in most IDEs.
- Asynchronous Java Script: Async operations are an important part of Figma plugins, such as for loading pages or requesting and using data that may take a brief time to return.
- TypeScript: Figma provides TypeScript types for the various methods, interfaces, and other features that are a part of the Plugin API.
- Webpack, to bundle large multi-file projects and import libraries: Bundling helps pack dependencies into the format required for Figma plugins.
- React, Vue, etc. to create complex user interfaces.

### Plugin Quickstart Guide

This QuickStart guide takes you through the setup of our recommended development environment: using TypeScript in Visual Studio Code. You don’t have to use this combination. You can write directly in JavaScript—or any language that translates to JavaScript—and use your preferred text editor.

By the end of this guide, you will have a plugin that opens a modal, asks the user for a number, and creates that many rectangles on the canvas of a Figma design file. If you’re new to Figma plugin development, make sure to read through our plugin concepts. They cover information, such as required knowledge, how plugins run, and what you can do with plugins.

#### Download tools

Before we begin, you need to install the following tools:

- **The Figma desktop app:** Plugin development and testing requires the Figma desktop app. Figma will need to read your plugin code saved as a local file. You can download it from the Figma downloads page. If you already have the desktop app installed, make sure you’re running the latest version.
- **Visual Studio Code:** This is the development environment you’ll be using for the QuickStart guide.

#### Create a new plugin

1. Log into the desktop app and create a new design file.
2. From the menu, navigate to **Plugins** > **Development**, then select **New plugin.**
3. From the **Create a plugin** modal, select **Figma design** and give your plugin a name.
4. Select **Custom UI**
5. Click **Save as** to save it anywhere on your disk.

#### Open the plugin code folder

1. Launch Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to **File** > **Open Folder** and then select the folder you saved when you created a new plugin.
3. If you see a verification modal, check the box and click **Yes, I trust the authors** to proceed.


#### Install project dependencies

When you first open the project in Visual Studio Code, you may notice a few errors highlighted in our files. To fix this, we’ll need to install some project dependencies.


##### Node.js and npm

**Node** provides a way to run JavaScript outside of the browser and npm is the default package manager for Node.

**Npm** is both a command-line tool and an online repository of open source Node.js projects. Instead of manually including dependencies in our project, npm makes it easy to install these dependencies using scripts.

When you download Node from the Nodejs.org website, your download also includes npm.

1. Select the installer to start the Node.js Setup Wizard.
2. When the installer asks about tools for native modules, check **Automatically install the necessary tools** and select **Next**.
3. Select **Install**.
4. After the install is complete, select **Finish**.

You can check that Node.js was successfully installed in Visual Studio Code.

In Visual Studio Code, select **Terminal** > **New terminal**. Type `node` into the terminal and press `enter`.

The terminal should return the version of Node.js you installed. If you’re not seeing this message, restart Visual Studio and run the command again.

Hit `Ctrl`-`C` twice to exit Node.


##### TypeScript

We recommend using Type Script for developing Figma plugins. We provide a typings file with type annotations for the entire Plugin API.

When you install the typings for the Plugin API, Visual Studio Code provides you with suggestions as you code.


This helps to reduce errors and catch edge cases. You can only use the typings file with TypeScript.

If you take a look at the file named `package.json`, under `devDependencies` you’ll notice that we’ve already included:

- TypeScript: `typescript`
- The plugin typings: `@figma/plugin-typings`
- ESLint and the linter dependencies:
- `eslint`
- `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`
- `@typescript-eslint/parser`
- `@figma/eslint-plugin-figma-plugins`
- The configuration for the plugin linter


`npm` allows us to install all dependencies from `package.json` using a single command.

1. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code. You can toggle the terminal view under **View** > **Terminal**. If you want to start with a new terminal, go to **Terminal** > **New terminal**.
2. In the terminal type `npm install` and press `Enter`.

If the dependencies were installed, there should be no errors highlighted in our files. You’ll also notice a new dropdown in the Explorer named `node_modules`.

A new dropdown directory will be available under **Explorer.** If you expand this, you’ll see a few starter files already exist in our project.

You can check that TypeScript was successfully installed in Visual Studio Code.

In Visual Studio Code, select **Terminal** > **New terminal**. Type `tsc -v` into the terminal and press `enter`.

The terminal should return the version of TypeScript you installed. If you’re not seeing this message, restart Visual Studio and run the command again.

##### Plugin linter

Linting, the automated validation of source code for issues, can be very helpful for catching errors early in the development of your plugin. Figma provides a set of typescript-eslint rulesto help support plugin development. These rules can identify, and in many cases automatically fix, issues in your plugin code.

When you create your plugin, the plugin linter is already included in the dependencies and ready to go. We provide the following configuration in `package.json`:

```
"eslintConfig": { "extends": [ "eslint:recommended", "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended", "plugin:@figma/figma-plugins/recommended" ], "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser", "parserOptions": { "project": "./tsconfig.json" }, "root": true, "rules": { "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": [ "error", { "argsIgnorePattern": "^_", "varsIgnorePattern": "^_", "caughtErrorsIgnorePattern": "^_" } ] }}
```

Find the `eslint-plugin-figma-plugins` repository on Git Hub →

#### Set up TypeScript compilation

With your dependencies installed, all that's left for us to do is to make sure that TypeScript compiles to JavaScript in order for the plugin to run.

Since Figma plugins run in the browser, and browsers only support JavaScript, the `main` field in our manifest will **always** point to a JavaScript file.

Compilation is the process responsible for making sure that our TypeScript gets turned into usable JavaScript that allows our plugin to run.

To setup your project to watch for changes then automatically compile:

1. Hit `Ctrl`-`Shift`-`B` in Windows, or `Command`-`Shift`-`B` for Mac.
2. Select **watch-tsconfig.json**

You’ll need to run this command each time you close the project folder or relaunch Visual Studio Code.

#### Run the sample plugin

1. Open up the design file you created in the Figma desktop app.
2. Navigate to **Plugins** > **Development**, then select the name of your plugin.
3. When the plugin modal pops up, click **Create** to run the plugin.

You should see five orange rectangles in the canvas.

Your set up is now complete! Ready to start coding your first plugin? Check out the fourth video in our Build Your First Plugin video series.

#### Hot reloading

Figma provides the option to hot reload your plugin to speed up the development process. As you edit the plugin code and rebuild, the plugin will automatically restart with the latest changes. If turned off, you will need to manually restart the plugin.

### Setting Editor Type

The editor Type field is a required field in plugin manifests. Use it to specify which editor your plugin works in. You can create plugins for a specific editor type (i.e. one of Figma's editor products), a combination of editor types, or build plugins that perform different actions in each editor. You can use any of the below combinations of editor types:

Specifying supported editor types in manifest.json

```
// A plugin that works in Figma design and FigJam"editorType": [ "figjam", "figma"]// A plugin that works in Figma design and Dev Mode"editorType": [ "figma", "dev"]// A plugin that only works in Figma design"editorType": [ "figma"]// A plugin that only works in FigJam"editorType": [ "figjam"]// A plugin that only works in Dev Mode"editorType": [ "dev"]// A plugin that only works in Figma Slides"editorType": [ "slides"]// A plugin that only works in Figma Buzz"editorType": [ "buzz"]
```

Plugins cannot specify both `"dev"` and `"figjam"` editor types at the same time.

Keep in mind, when you specify multiple editor types, your plugin won't have access to certain functions and events depending on the editor the plugin runs in. For example, if you use `figma.createSticky()`, the code will work while the plugin is running in FigJam, but not when you run it in Figma.

Learn more about which APIs are accessible in each editor:

- Working with Fig Jam
- Working in Dev Mode
- Working in Slides
- Working in Buzz

If you want to set conditional logic in your plugin to assign behavior based on the editor the plugin is running in, you can use the method `figma.editor Type`. This will return a string value of `figma`, `figjam`, `dev`, `slides`, or `buzz`.

Using figma.editorType to check where the plugin is being run

```
if (figma.editorType === 'figjam') { // In FigJam}if (figma.editorType === 'figma') { // In Figma design mode}if (figma.editorType === 'dev') { // In Figma's Dev Mode}if (figma.editorType === 'slides') { // In Figma Slides}if (figma.editorType === 'buzz') { // In Figma Buzz}
```

### How Plugins Run

Figma plugins are written using primarily JavaScript and HTML. The environment exposed to plugins by the Figma editor, FigJam, Figma Slides, and Figma Buzz is very similar to a standard web browser and includes many of the same features. There are, however, some important differences.

In order for a plugin system to be secure and stable, some browser APIs are unavailable or need to be accessed differently. This is imporant to understand so you can answer questions like:

- How do I access the contents of a Figma file?
- How do I create a user interface for my plugin?
- How do I make network requests?

#### Plugin environment

For performance, Figma uses an execution model where plugin code runs on the **main thread in a sandbox**. The sandbox is a minimal JavaScript environment and **does not expose browser APIs**. This means that you have all of standard JavaScript ES6+ available, including the standard types, the JSON and Promise APIs, binary types like Uint8Array, etc. We have also added a minimal version of the console API. But browser APIs like XMLHttpRequest and the DOM are not _directly_ available from the sandbox.

To use browser APIs or show a custom UI for your plugin, you need to create an `<iframe>`with a `<script>` tag inside. This can be done with `figma.show UI()`. Inside of this `<iframe>`, you can write any HTML/JavaScript and access any browser APIs. To see the list of available JavaScript/Browser APIs on the main thread, run `console.log(this)` as the first line of your plugin.

The main thread can access the Figma "scene" (the hierarchy of layers that make up a Figma document) but not the browser APIs. Conversely, the iframe can access the browser APIs, but not the Figma scene. The main thread and the iframe can communicate with each other through **message passing**.

Additional network security is enforced if your plugin limits network access. When network access is limited, if your plugin attempts to access a domain that isn't specified in your plugin's manifest, Figma blocks that attempt and returns a content-security policy (CSP) error.

The enforcement of domain access is limited only to requests made by the plugin, such as Fetch API requests to a public REST API. If your plugin renders a website in an iframe, network access limits only apply directly to the website's domain. Network access limits do not affect resources needed by that website. For example, suppose your plugin limits access only to `figma.com`. Your plugin would be prevented from rendering content from other domains. However, `figma.com` would still be able to load external resources, such as scripts for Google Analytics.

When the plugin is finished with its work, it must call `figma.closePlugin()` to tell Figma that it is finished. If a plugin is not properly closed, the plugin runs indefinitely and the user sees a "Running [your plugin name]" toast notification until they close the tab.

Note that the user can cancel the plugin at any point by using the UI that Figma displays while the plugin is running. When this happens, Figma will itself call `figma.closePlugin()`.

#### File loading

Pages in Figma files are loaded as needed, and most plugins will _not_ require access to a user’s complete Figma document. If your plugin acts on multiple or all pages in a user's file, you can still improve the experience of users in a very large file by having your plugin load more pages only as needed. To help, TypeScript type definitions are available in our official typings.

### Accessing the Document

This section provides a brief overview of how your plugin accesses the document of a Figma, FigJam, Figma Slides, or Figma Buzz file and some of the APIs you are most likely to use. Check out the reference to see the full extent of the Figma Plugin API.

#### Figma files and nodes

Figma, FigJam, Figma Slides, and Figma Buzz files are structured as node trees. Your plugin can traverse nodes in the tree in order to access different parts of the document.

**DocumentNode** The Document Node is the root of the node tree in Figma, FigJam, Figma Slides, and Figma Buzz files. Each Figma file contains a single instance of a DocumentNode. A DocumentNode contains one or more PageNodes.

**PageNode** Page Nodes are the immediate descendants of the DocumentNode. A Figma design or FigJam file contains one or more PageNodes (one for each page in the document). Figma Slides and Figma Buzz files only have a single PageNode, accessed using `figma.currentPage`.

PageNodes are, from the user’s perspective, the fundamental way to interact with Figma. For example, when a user opens a Figma file, the page the user lands on is represented by a PageNode, as well as the rest of the pages in the file. Each PageNode contains an array of children that represent the layers on a page. The order of the children in the array corresponds to the order of the layers in the editor.

Figma files contain at least one PageNode. The node tree always contains a PageNode for every page, but only some PageNodes will have their content fully loaded. This is a feature of Figma files called dynamic page loading.

Complete PageNodes are only loaded by the editor when necessary. For example:

- When the user navigates to a page in the editor.
- When a plugin calls a Plugin API method to load another page or contents from another page.

#### Getting the current selection

Most often, a plugin does something on the user’s current page with whatever the user has currently selected. Each page stores its selection independently. To obtain the selection of the current page, use `figma.currentPage.selection`, which returns a `ReadonlyArray<BaseNode>`.

This short plugin makes the current selection half as transparent, then closes:

Get current selection

```
for (const node of figma.currentPage.selection) { if ("opacity" in node) { node.opacity *= 0.5 }}figma.closePlugin()
```

If you just want to work with one of the selected layers (common when testing), you can use `figma.currentPage.selection[0]`. Just keep in mind, there are always three situations your plugin needs to handle:

- No layer is selected
- A single layer is selected
- Multiple layers are selected

**Note:** In Dev Mode, users can only select one node at a time, and thus `figma.currentPage.selection` returns only one object in Dev Mode.

Learn more in the Working in Dev Mode guide →

#### Loading pages and nodes

While most plugins will only need to access the current page, there may be use cases where your plugin needs to load additional pages. Because Figma loads pages in a file as needed, only the user’s current page is guaranteed to be completely loaded. Functionally, this means that you cannot expect a node on another page to be available to your plugin unless you've _explicitly loaded_ the page that contains the node or you've asynchronously accessed the node.

To find the content on a page that you want to work with, your plugin will usually iterate over `PageNode.children`. However, before accessing the content of a page outside the user's current page, your plugin must explicitly load that PageNode using the `loadAsync()`method. `PageNode.children` will throw an exception if called on a page that is not the current page and has not been explicitly loaded by the plugin using `loadAsync()`.

Example: Logging the number of children on all pages

```
for (const page of figma.root.children) { await page.loadAsync() console.log(`Page ${page.name} has ${page.children.length} children`)}
```

The previous example iterates over the PageNodes (`page`) on the DocumentNode (`figma.root.children`). For each `page`, the code calls the `loadAsync()` method. Then, the properties of the PageNode (for example, `page.children`) can be safely accessed by the plugin.

**Note:** Loading a page doesn’t navigate a user to that page; it simply guarantees the data for that page is available to your plugin. To simultaneously load and navigate a user to a page, use `await setCurrentPageAsync()`.

#### Node types

Each node has a `type` field which indicates its type, which is helpful if your plugin only needs to operate on certain types of nodes. For example, a spellchecking plugin is likely to only care about nodes where `node.type === "TEXT"`.

Nodes of a given type have a particular set of fields that your plugin can read and write. For example, rectangle nodes (nodes with `"RECTANGLE"`) have a `.cornerRadius` field, but not a `.constraints` field. On the other hand, frames (nodes with type `"FRAME"`) `.constraints`field, but not a `.cornerRadius` field.

**Caution:** In order to build a plugin that doesn't crash, you should always think about how to handle unexpected node types. Even if your plugin only cares about certain node nodes, users may try to run your plugin with any node type. Ensure your plugin provides feedback to the user if they try to use it on a node type you don't support. You can do this using the `figma.notify()` function.

#### Full document traversal

**Important:** While the Plugin API makes it possible to traverse all pages of a document, Figma strongly recommends that plugins don't do so unless they're performing document-wide actions (like find-and-replace or calculating statistics across a file). Because Figma loads pages as needed, plugins that traverse all pages must first load every page. In very large and complex files, this will result in a significant delay the first time a user opens a file and runs that plugin. To avoid this delay, plugins should only load the specific pages they need.

Because the Figma editor only loads pages as needed, if you want to traverse the whole document, your plugin must first call `figma.loadAllPagesAsync()`. This ensures that all pages in the file are correctly loaded before your plugin tries to traverse the pages.

In order to search through an entire document, without any node-based filtering, you can use the `node.findOne()` and `node.findAll()` functions. Again, carefully consider if your plugin needs to do this as it requires that you load all pages using `figma.loadAllPagesAsync()` and could lead to performance issues for your plugin in large files.

Built-in traversal helpers

```
figma.loadAllPagesAsync() // ensures all PageNodes are loaded, can be slow in very large files// Finds the first text node with more than 100 charactersconst node = node.findOne(node => { return node.type === "TEXT" && node.characters.length > 100})// Finds all empty frame nodesconst nodes = node.findAll(node => { return node.type === "FRAME" && node.children.length === 0})
```

In general, if you want to have full control over how you traverse the document, you will have to write a recursive function.

Custom traversal

```
// This plugin counts the number of layers, ignoring instance sublayers,// in the documentfigma.loadAllPagesAsync() // ensures all PageNodes are loaded, can be slow in very large fileslet count = 0function traverse(node) { if ("children" in node) { count++ if (node.type !== "INSTANCE") { for (const child of node.children) { traverse(child) } } }}traverse(figma.root) // start the traversal at the rootalert(count)figma.closePlugin()
```

### Asynchronous Tasks

This article covers asynchronous tasks in JavaScript and provides code examples. It may be helpful to understand some JavaScript fundamentals before you continue.Check out the required knowledge here →

The Plugin API and Widget API include both synchronous and asynchronous functions. Usually, asynchronous functions in the Plugin API and Widget API are identified by an `Async`suffix, such as **`load Font Async()`**.

In this article, we’ll explain the differences between the two. We'll also explore how asynchronous functions can make your API communication more effective and why Figma favors asynchronous code for some plugin operations.

#### Synchronous requests

With synchronous requests, the caller must wait for a response before other requests are made. Synchronous requests are used when data is expected to return immediately. In the case of a Figma plugin, the client is usually the active tab of a web browser or the Figma desktop app.

You have likely encountered these kinds of tasks in other situations, like waiting for a photo to upload before you can continue using an application. During this time you could see a progress bar, spinning circle, or loading screen.

You can think of synchronous requests like getting in line at the grocery store or drive through. Each request is handled one at a time. Unlike at the grocery store, synchronous tasks can’t jump the queue. Those who were in line before you must complete their transactions before you can move forward and begin your own check out process.

Typically, code written in JavaScript runs one line at a time, in the order it was written. Consider the following code:

```
console.log("I am");console.log("synchronous");console.log("JavaScript");
```

As JavaScript is synchronous by default, the console output looks like:

1. “I am” is the first output in the JavaScript console.
2. “synchronous” is the next output.
3. “JavaScript” is the final output.

While synchronous programming works in this example, synchronous tasks aren’t always the best approach. Since each task must wait for the previous request to receive a response before proceeding, it can slow down larger, more complex applications where response times are unpredictable.

This is especially true when network requests and latency are added as considerations. Since you can’t guarantee how fast or stable a user’s internet connection is (that is, how long it will take to transfer data to and from the user) or how long it might take a server to respond to a request, the potential slowdown to synchronous code can be significant.

#### Asynchronous requests

Unlike synchronous requests, asynchronous requests don’t need to wait on a response before proceeding. Instead, a **callback** is provided to notify the client when a response is ready. Asynchronous requests are useful when an API’s response time varies based on the availability of a resource.

You can think of this as ordering something from a coffee shop. You get in line, your order is taken, then you give your name so the barista can call you when your order is ready. In an API, your name is the request **token** or unique identifier.

In a coffee shop, orders won’t always come out in the order they were placed. An americano will take less time than a frothy coffee with latte art! The same can be said of asynchronous requests.

This way, other requests can continue to process in the background and the application can keep its functionality while waiting for responses. An asynchronous approach can be an efficient solution when the API’s response time is unpredictable due to variables in data size and complexity.

##### Promises

As the client doesn’t need to wait for a response from the API, we need another way to communicate the status of that task. This is where **Promises** come into play.

Asynchronous programming in modern JavaScript is built on the concept of **Promises**. A **Promise** is an object returned by an asynchronous request and can be in one of three states:

- **Pending**: The promise has been created but the request has not been **fulfilled** or **rejected**.
- **Fulfilled**: The asynchronous request was successful. When a promise is **fulfilled**, the `.then()` handler is called.
- **Rejected**: The asynchronous request failed. When a promise is **rejected**, the `.catch()`handler is called.

Consider the following code:

```
const fetchPromise = fetch("https://httpbin.org/anything");fetchPromise.then((response) => { const textPromise = response.text(); textPromise.then((data) => { console.log(data); figma.closePlugin(); });});
```

In this example, we are using the `fetch()`API to request some data from the Figma API. When we `fetch()` from the Figma API, a Promise is returned. An asynchronous function is helpful here because we don’t know how long it will take for the API to respond with the requested data.

Once the Promise state is **fulfilled**, the `.then()` handler is called. We are saying that if the response was successful, turn the response into JSON then output the data. The returned data should look something like this:

```
{ "args": {}, "data": "", "files": {}, "form": {}, "headers": { ... }, "json": null, "method": "GET", "origin": "...", "url": "https://httpbin.org/anything"}
```

If the Promise is **rejected**, an error is returned. We can view this error by adding the `.catch()` handler to our code:

```
const fetchPromise = fetch("https://httpbin.org/anything");fetchPromise .then((response) => { const textPromise = response.text(); textPromise.then((data) => { console.log(data); }) .catch((error) => { console.error(error); }); figma.closePlugin();});
```

##### Async and Await

The `async` and `await` keywords allow us to use asynchronous functions that look like synchronous code. Using `async` and `await` can improve the performance of your application since it continues to run while waiting on a response. These keywords allow you to write asynchronous code in a neat, organized and readable way.

Adding `async` at the start of function definition turns it into an asynchronous function. Inside an asynchronous function, the `await` keyword can be used before a function call that returns a Promise. If we rewrite our earlier example using `async` and `await`, it would look like this:

```
async function fetchData(){ try { const response = await fetch("https://httpbin.org/anything"); const text = await response.text(); console.log(`Response text is: ${text}`); } catch (error) { console.error(error); } figma.closePlugin();}fetchData();
```

With `async` and `await`, we can use `try...catch` blocks for error handling as if we were working with synchronous code.

#### Asynchronous tasks in the Figma Plugin API

To make asynchronous development as easy as possible with the Plugin and Widget API, Figma provides async functions in the Plugin API. Here are some examples of asynchronous tasks in Figma:

##### [loadAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/PageNode/#loadasync)

You’ll need to use this function to asynchronously load individual PageNodes that your plugin wants to access.

The Figma editor uses dynamic page loading, which means that pages other than a user’s current page aren’t guaranteed to be loaded. This results in nodes on unloaded pages not being available to a plugin. The `loadAsync` function ensures that a PageNode and its dependencies are completely loaded and able to be used by your plugin.

```
for (const page of figma.root.children) { // PageNodes are the only children of root await page.loadAsync() console.log(`Page ${page.name} has ${page.children.length} children`)}
```

##### [loadFontAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-loadfontasync/)

This is the most common async function in the Plugin API. You'll need to use this function if you want your plugin to modify or re-render text nodes.

Font files aren’t always available in the browser’s memory. Especially if the file lives on a user’s local machine. If someone runs your plugin in a file that doesn’t have those fonts loaded, they won’t be able to edit any text nodes. The `loadFontAsync` function makes sure all fonts in the file are loaded and ready to use.

```
figma.ui.onmessage = async (pluginMessage) => { await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: "Rubik", style: "Regular" });...
```

##### [exportAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-exportasync/)

This function exports a selected node as an encoded image. In the example below, a polygon is created then exported as a PNG at 2x resolution. We use `await` to ensure that the polygon object is properly created before we attempt to export it.

When settings for `format` and `constraint` aren’t specified, `exportAsync` defaults to exporting the node as a PNG at 1x resolution.

```
async () => { const polygon = figma.createPolygon() polygon.pointCount = 6 polygon.fills = [{ type: 'SOLID', color: { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0 } }] // Export a 2x resolution PNG of the node const bytes = await polygon.exportAsync({ format: 'PNG', constraint: { type: 'SCALE', value: 2 }, })}
```

Here are other useful asynchronous functions in the Plugin API:

- `save Version History Async`: Saves a new version of the file and adds it to the version history of the file. Returns the new version id.
- `create Link Preview Async`: **(FigJam only)**
- `figma.client Storage`
- `get Publish Status Async`
- `wait For Task`: **(Widget API)**
- `Image` - Learn more about working with images in the Plugin API →

#### Upgrade synchronous code to async

Figma offers a guide to help with you upgrade plugins to use asynchronous functions and to be compatible with dynamic page loading. Migrating Plugins to Dynamically Load Pages →

### Editing Properties

In many cases, editing a node property is as straightforward as changing a property on a regular node object. For example, this is how you could move a node 10 pixels to the right:

Simple change

```
node.x += 10 // easy!
```

However, for more complex properties that are stored as arrays and objects, you will notice that we marked all the properties in those objects as `readonly`. That means that the following, which you may naturally be inclined to try, won't work:

Readonly properties

```
// error: object is not extensiblefigma.currentPage.selection.push(otherNode)// error: Cannot assign to read only property 'r' of objectnode.fills[0].color.r = 10
```

In Figma design's Dev Mode, plugins can only edit certain node metadata, such as plugin Data, relaunch Data, and `export Async()`.

Learn more in the Working in Dev Mode → guide.

#### The 'How'

For all node properties, making a change to a property requires setting the entire property. Often, this will mean making a copy of the original property, which can then be modified.

For arrays of nodes like `selection` where you want to make a copy of the array, but not the nodes themselves, an easy way to make a copy of the array is to use `array.slice()`. Other array methods that return a new array include `array.concat()` and `array.map()`. Keep in mind that most array methods such as `array.push()` do not create a new array, though they may be used on a copy of the array.

Example:

Changing selection

```
// Example 1: Adding a new element to the selection via `concat`figma.currentPage.selection = figma.currentPage.selection.concat(someNode)// Example 2: Adding a new element to the selection via `slice`const selection = figma.currentPage.selection.slice()selection.push(someNode)figma.currentPage.selection = selection// Creating a new selection. This is more efficient// than editing `page.selection` repeatedly.const newSelection = []newSelection.push(...)newSelection.push(...)newSelection.push(...)newSelection.push(...)figma.currentPage.selection = newSelection// Remove element in selection at index iconst selection = figma.currentPage.selection.slice()selection.splice(i, 1)figma.currentPage.selection = selection
```

For objects such as fills/paints, you'll want to do something similar, which is to clone the object.

Change fills

```
// Example: Changing the red channel of the first fillconst fills = clone(rect.fills)fills[0].color.r = 0.5rect.fills = fills
```

For more detail on changing color properties, see the Changing Colors section below.

There's many ways to implement such a clone function. A simple though inefficient one-liner would be:

Simple clone function

```
function clone(val) { return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(val))}
```

A perhaps more principled way of cloning would look like:

Better clone function

```
function clone(val) { const type = typeof val if (val === null) { return null } else if (type === 'undefined' || type === 'number' || type === 'string' || type === 'boolean') { return val } else if (type === 'object') { if (val instanceof Array) { return val.map(x => clone(x)) } else if (val instanceof Uint8Array) { return new Uint8Array(val) } else { let o = {} for (const key in val) { o[key] = clone(val[key]) } return o } } throw 'unknown'}
```

##### Changing colors

A common use case is to modify a node fill with a solid color. Color objects in the Plugin API use separate numeric properties for each color channel, but you can use `figma.util.solid Paint` to set both color and opacity using familiar CSS string encodings:

Setting colors using figma.util.solidPaint

```
if (fills[0].type === 'SOLID') { const fills = clone(rect.fills) fills[0] = figma.util.solidPaint("#FF00FF88", fills[0]) rect.fills = fills}
```

For setting colors on other types of API objects, see `figma.util.rgb` and `figma.util.rgba`.

#### The 'Why'

_Bonus material, entirely optional_

For your curiosity, properties work this way to defend you against easy mistakes while working around some limitations of JavaScript.

This way of editing properties is not our #1 choice of API design, but...

1. When writing `color = node.fills[0].color`, the `color` object has to be either a copy or a merely view into the source-of-truth that we store internally. We can't expose the internal one because:

- Of stability reasons
- In some cases, the internal one has a more complex structure that we simplified for the API
- Many things have to happen inside Figma when a property is changed (e.g. re-render, update instances)
- The real `color` isn't even a JavaScript object, but somewhere in Web Assembly memory

Example:

Erroneous edit

```
// This wouldn't do anything, which is even more// confusing, so we throw an exceptionnode.fills.[0].color.r = 0.5
```

In the above example, setting a property on a plain JS object can't notify Figma of changes.

2. We could have properties like `node.fills` return magic objects that can notify Figma of changes using getter, setters, or even proxies. However, that would require us to re-implement JavaScript arrays, which is not advisable. It also leads to other confusing situations:

Confusing edit

```
// just a plain arraylet selection = [A, B, C]// converts plain array into magic array?figma.currentPage.selection = selection// doesn't do anything, still a plain arrayselection.push(D)
```

In addition, due to the need to pass plain objects when message-passing between the main thread and the UI, the magic objects would have to be converted back and forth to plain objects anyway.

Debugging via `console.log` would also be quite painful. Since getters & setters have to be evaluated, everything would always appear as `(...)` in the console that you would need to click to expand. Whereas currently, `console.log(node.fills)` prints out the entire fills object correctly.

In the end, while magic objects would be convenient in some cases, they are only convenient if they look as much like normal objects as possible. But if they did, it would be hard to tell the two apart. Since it wouldn't be possible to fully hide the abstraction, the abstraction would fail in random, hard to predict ways.

Note: node objects _are_ magic objects with getters & setters, because they have to be. But there's a big difference between having a magic object and a magic object whose properties recursively return magic objects.

### TypeScript

In `manifest.json`, the `main` field always takes a JavaScript file. After all, plugins run in the browser, and browsers only support JavaScript.

You're free to use plain JavaScript, or any of the languages that can be translated into JavaScript. However, to build a quality plugin that won't crash in unexpected situations, we **strongly** recommend the use of TypeScript.

#### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is **not a new language**. It is an extension of the JavaScript language. You can write JavaScript code, paste it into a TypeScript file. Congratulations, you've just written TypeScript!

TypeScript allows you to add _type annotations_ to your code. These don't change how your code runs, they are just notes for yourself and for the compiler

Sample TypeScript

```
// The ': string[]' is an annotationlet list: string[] = []for (const node of figma.currentPage.selection) { list.push(node.type)}// The ': number' are also annotationsfunction doThing(x: number, str: string) { // ...}
```

In addition, we provide type annotations for the entire Figma API. It looks like this:

plugin-typings

```
interface PluginAPI { readonly command: string readonly root: DocumentNode readonly timer?: TimerAPI readonly viewport: ViewportAPI closePlugin(message?: string): void showUI(html: string, options?: ShowUIOptions): void readonly ui: UIAPI readonly util: UtilAPI readonly clientStorage: ClientStorageAPI getNodeByIdAsync(id: string): Promise<BaseNode> | null getStyleByIdAsync(id: string): Promise<BaseStyle> | null ...}
```

Paired with an editor like Visual Studio Code, the editor is smart about knowing what variable has which properties, _while you are typing_!

These type annotations are more than just comments with a new syntax. The TypeScript compiler can use them to detect accidental errors.

Detecting accidental errors with TypeScript

```
let list: string[] = []for (const node of figma.currentPage.selection) { // Error! Type SceneNode is not assignable to type 'string' list.push(node)}
```

Having the compiler tell you about errors generally allows you to develop faster. It's much easier to catch and fix errors when the compiler tells you exactly what line is wrong, whereas having to test the plugin to find bugs (or worse, having your _users_ test the plugin) is much more expensive. TypeScript doesn't prevent all bugs from happening of course, but it does eliminate a large class of them.

#### How do I use the Figma API with TypeScript?

One of the main reasons we want you to use TypeScript is that there are many node types in Figma, and all of them are slightly different. For example, it's easy to forget nodes like boolean operations or slices. And it's possible your plugin doesn't care about them, which is fine, but it shouldn't crash if it runs into one!

Consider, for example, this function which turns a frame into a component:

Erroneous way to turn frame into a component

```
function turnFrameIntoComponent() { const selection: SceneNode = figma.currentPage.selection[0] if (!selection) { return } const component = figma.createComponent() component.x = selection.x component.y = selection.y component.resize(selection.width, selection.height) // Copy children into new node for (const child of selection.children) { component.appendChild(child) } selection.remove()}
```

This code could crash. The user might not necessarily have a frame selected when running the plugin! TypeScript will tell you that.

The correct thing to do is to check the `type` property of a node before using it.

Correct way to turn frame into a component

```
function turnFrameIntoComponent() { const selection: SceneNode = figma.currentPage.selection[0] if (!selection) { return } if (selection.type !== 'FRAME') { return } // <---- const component = figma.createComponent() component.x = selection.x component.y = selection.y component.resize(selection.width, selection.height) // Copy children into new node for (const child of selection.children) { component.appendChild(child) } selection.remove()}
```

And the compiler is smart enough that, past that point, `selection` is always a `FrameNode`which always has a `children` property. It knows to narrow down `SceneNode` to `FrameNode`. Just hover over `selection` to see!

TypeScript also supports type unions. In this example, `NodeWithChildren` is one of four node types.

```
type NodeWithChildren = FrameNode | ComponentNode | InstanceNode | BooleanOperationNode
```

You can combine multiple of these checks together. For example, if you often find yourself needing to check that a node has the `children` property, you can write a helper function for that. This function's return value is a type predicate, which tells the compiler that if `supportsChildren` evaluates to true, then the argument must necessarily be of type `(FrameNode | ComponentNode | InstanceNode | BooleanOperationNode)`.

Multiple type checks

```
function supportsChildren(node: SceneNode): node is FrameNode | ComponentNode | InstanceNode | BooleanOperationNode{ return node.type === 'FRAME' || node.type === 'GROUP' || node.type === 'COMPONENT' || node.type === 'INSTANCE' || node.type === 'BOOLEAN_OPERATION'}const selection = figma.currentPage.selection[0]if (supportsChildren(selection)) { // Inside this if statement, selection always has .children property console.log(selection.children)}
```

#### Lint your TypeScript

Linting, the automated validation of source code for issues, can be very helpful for catching errors early in the development of your plugin. Figma provides a set of typescript-eslint rulesto help support plugin development. These rules can identify, and in many cases automatically fix, issues in your plugin code.

To install and use the linter, follow the instructions in the **Usage** section of the README included with the linter rules. Find the `eslint-plugin-figma-plugins` repository on Git Hub →

#### Type errors are slowing you down?

In some cases, you _know_ your code is correct, but you can't seem to convince the compiler. One way to tell the compiler something is to use a type cast.

Type casting

```
// Prints the number of children. 'as NodeWithChildren'// tells the compiler you're sure about what you're doingconst selection = figma.currentPage.selection[0]console((selection as NodeWithChildren).children)
```

In even more extreme measures, you can use the `as any` cast to have TypeScript not type-check a particular variable at all. It's reasonable to do this sometimes, particularly when prototyping where you want to move as fast as possible. But try not to leave these type casts around. The compiler sometimes raises false alarms, but it finds bugs pretty often too!

### Creating a User Interface

The `figma.show UI()` function shows a plugin's user interface. The easiest way to use this function is to do the following:

1. Create a HTML file containing the markup for your UI.
2. Change `manifest.json` to contain `"ui": "ui.html"` where `"ui.html"` is the filename of your HTML file.
3. Put the following call in your plugin code:

```
figma.showUI(__html__)
```

This will display the contents of your HTML file in an `<iframe>` inside of Figma.

We strongly recommend using the `themeColors` option in `figma.showUI()` and using the CSS variables that it provides to your UI to support light and dark themes.

#### Sending messages between the UI and plugin code

After you've called `figma.showUI()`, you will likely want to send messages between the UI and the plugin code. For example, you might send information about the current document from the plugin code to be displayed in your plugin's user interface. Or you might send user input to the plugin code before performing some action.

##### Sending a message from the UI to the plugin code

To send a message from the UI to the plugin code, write the following in your HTML:

```
<script>...parent.postMessage({ pluginMessage: 'anything here' }, '*')...</script>
```

To receive the message in the plugin code, write:

```
figma.ui.onmessage = (message) => { console.log("got this from the UI", message)}
```

##### Sending a message from the plugin code to the UI

To send a message from the plugin code to the UI, write:

```
figma.ui.postMessage(42)
```

To receive that message in the UI, write the following in your HTML:

```
<script>...onmessage = (event) => { console.log("got this from the plugin code", event.data.pluginMessage)}...</script>
```

Note: the syntax for sending and receiving messages in the UI and the syntax for doing the same in the plugin code are subtly different. In the plugin code, you directly send and receive the values that you want to send. However, inside in the UI, you must send values on a `pluginMessage` property. Likewise, received data will appear on a `pluginMessage` property. When calling `postMessage` in the UI, you must also specify a second argument with the value `'*'`.

You can send almost any structured data in either direction, including objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, `undefined`, `Date` objects and `Uint8Array` objects. However, keep in mind that this is similar to sending a serialized JSON representation of the object. Methods of the object (or in general, the prototype chain of sent objects) will _not_ be recovered.

You can start sending messages from the plugin code to the UI as soon as `figma.showUI()`has been called. The messages will automatically be queued until the `<iframe>` containing the UI finishes loading.

Note: currently, you cannot send `Blob` objects, `ArrayBuffer`s or `TypedArray`objects other than `Uint8Array`.

##### Non-null origin iframes

If you'd like, you can also navigate the iframe to a custom URL by doing:

```
figma.showUI(`<script>window.location.href = "https://..."</script>`)
```

If you do this, sending a message from the UI to the main plugin code becomes slightly different. You'll also need to specify a `pluginId` value as part of the message to indicate if it is safe to deliver the message to any plugin OR just the one whose id is specified.

If the data you're sending back to your plugin is potentially sensitive, specifying a specific `pluginId` prevents other plugins from navigating their iframes to the same url to receive the pluginMessage. You should also pass in `'https://www.figma.com'` as the second argument to `parent.postMessage` to prevent other websites from embedding your iframe and intercepting the postMessage information anyway.

```
<script>...// Only the plugin with id 123456 and www.figma.com is allow to receive this message.parent.postMessage( { pluginMessage: 'anything here', pluginId: '123456' }, 'https://www.figma.com')// Any plugin id is allowed to receive the messageparent.postMessage({ pluginMessage: 'anything here', pluginId: '*' }, '*')...</script>
```

#### Triggering drop events from the UI

How your plugin code receives drop events coming from the UI will depend on whether you've navigated the iframe to a custom URL.

##### Drop events from a null origin iframe

If you have not navigated the iframe to a custom URL, then your plugin UI lives inside a null origin iframe, which prevents the Figma canvas from receiving drop events natively. Instead, we can use message passing to allow the UI to tell Figma the drop position and payload.

To trigger a drop event that can be received by the plugin code, include the following Javascript code in your UI:

```
parent.postMessage({ pluginDrop: PluginDrop }, '*')
```

where the `pluginDrop` property satisfies the following interface:

```
interface PluginDrop { // clientX and clientY taken from the browser's DragEvent clientX: number clientY: number items?: DropItem[] // array of File objects (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) files?: File[] dropMetadata?: any // use this to communicate additional data for the drop event}interface DropItem { type: string // e.g. "text/html", "text/uri-list", etc... data: string}
```

Figma will then fire a drop event to your plugin code with coordinates translated into canvas space (`absoluteX` and `absoluteY`) along with coordinates relative to the parent node (`x`and `y`).

###### Usage example

An icon library plugin could listen to `dragend` events in its UI and post a message to the plugin code with the `clientX` and `clientY` of the event along with the SVG data.

In the `drop` event callback, the event details are used to create a new node at the drop position under the correct parent node. For more information on `drop` event callbacks, please see the `figma.on` API reference.

See the figma/plugin-samples repository for a fully working example.

```
// In UIicon.addEventListener('dragend', e => { // Don't proceed if the item was dropped inside the plugin window. if (e.view.length === 0) return window.parent.postMessage( { pluginDrop: { clientX: e.clientX, clientY: e.clientY, items: [{ type: 'image/svg+xml', data: e.target.innerHTML }], } }, '*' )})
```

```
// In plugin codefigma.on('drop', (event) => { const { items, node, dropMetadata } = event if (items.length > 0 && items[0].type === 'image/svg+xml') { const newNode = figma.createNodeFromSvg(items[0].data) node.appendChild(newNode) newNode.x = event.x newNode.y = event.y figma.currentPage.selection = [newNode] return false }});
```

##### Drop events from a non-null origin iframe

If you have navigated the iframe to a custom URL, then Figma will be able to receive drop events from the plugin UI natively in the desktop app. However, some browsers have implemented security restrictions that prevent Figma from receiving native drop events in the web. We recommend using `postMessage` so that your plugin drag and drop works in both the desktop app and in browsers.

Note that when handling `dragEnd` events in non-null origin iframes, the coordinates from the event will be relative to the iframe. Figma expects `pluginDrop` coordiantes to be relative to the window. You can use `figma.ui.get Position()` to calculate the window space coordinates of your drop event.

See the figma/plugin-samples repository for a fully working example.

```
// In UIconst dragAndDropQueue = []// retrieve plugin iframe positiononmessage = (event) => { if (!dragAndDropQueue) { return; } const { position } = event.data.pluginMessage; const { coordinates, items } = dragAndDropQueue.shift(); // these coordinates are relative to the entire window const windowAdjustedCoordinates = { x: coordinates.x + position.windowSpace.x, y: coordinates.y + position.windowSpace.y, }; window.parent.postMessage({ pluginDrop: { clientX: windowAdjustedCoordinates.x, clientY: windowAdjustedCoordinates.y, items, }, pluginId: "your-id-here", }, "*");}icon.addEventListener('dragend', e => { dragAndDropQueue.append({ // these coordinates are relative to the iframe coordinates: { x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY } items: [{ type: 'image/svg+xml', data: e.target.innerHTML }], }) // instead of sending a dropEvent right away, ask the plugin // for its current position so we can calculate the // coordinates relative to the window window.parent.postMessage({ pluginMessage: { type: "request-plugin-position" }, pluginId: "your-id-here", }, "*");})
```

```
// In plugin code// send plugin position to UIfigma.ui.onmessage = (msg) => { if (msg.type === "request-plugin-position") { const position = figma.ui.getPosition(); figma.ui.postMessage({ position }); }};figma.on('drop', (event: DropEvent) => { console.log('[plugin] drop received!!', event); const { items } = event; if (items.length > 0 && items[0].type === 'image/svg+xml') { const data = items[0].data const newNode = figma.createNodeFromSvg(data); newNode.x = event.absoluteX; newNode.y = event.absoluteY; figma.currentPage.selection = [newNode]; } return false;});
```

### CSS Variables and Theming

In order to support light and dark themes in your plugin, you will need to update your call to `figma.showUI()` and replace applicable, hard-coded color values in your plugin CSS with the CSS variables shown here.

#### API Details

For your plugin UI to get access to the CSS variables, you will need to call `figma.showUI()`with the new themeColors option:

```
figma.showUI(__html__, { themeColors: true, /* other options */ })
```

This will lead to the following changes to the plugin `<iframe>`:

- A `figma-light` or `figma-dark` class will be added to the `<html>` element in the iframe content
- A `<style id="figma-style">` element will be added to the iframe content containing a set of CSS variables (`--figma-color-bg`, `--figma-color-text`, etc…)

You can then use these variables in your CSS using the `var()` function. For example:

Using CSS variables

```
body { background-color: var(--figma-color-bg); color: var(--figma-color-text);}
```

You can also use the `figma-light` or `figma-dark` classes on the `<html>` element to supply your own theme-specific colors:

Customize light and dark classes

```
.figma-light body { background-color: white; color: blue;}.figma-dark body { background-color: black; color: red;}
```

If the user changes their theme preference in Figma Design, the CSS variables in the plugin iframe will dynamically update with new color values.

Please note a couple of caveats with using this new theme API:

- FigJam currently does not support dark mode. **If your plugin supports FigJam, you will have access to CSS variables corresponding to a FigJam-specific light mode**. These variables will be named exactly the same as the ones in Figma, but have different colors. For example, FigJam has a purple accent color whereas Figma has a blue accent color.

- If your plugin UI navigates to another URL, do not use the new `themeColors` option in `figma.showUI()`.


Theme support for externally-hosted plugin UIs is not available at this time.

#### Semantic Color Tokens

The tokens we are exposing via the Plugin API use the same underlying schema that powers Dark Mode at Figma. At first glance, this may seem like a ton of tokens (and it is), but we’re really excited to be sharing our system in its purest form with our Plugin developers!

If you learn best by doing and want to explore our semantic tokens in an interactive way, install the Theme Colors Inspector plugin.

##### Tokens Overview

We’ve defined a naming schema that creates predictable behavior across our tokens. For example, additional hierarchy can be created by adding `-secondary` or `-tertiary` to any text, icon, or background color, and interactive behavior can be specified by adding `-hover`, `-selected`, `-disabled`.

Our tokens follow a format of

Semantic color token format

```
--figma-color-{type}-{color role}-{prominence}-{interaction}
```

This is the only required parameter, and specifies _what is the type of thing we want to color_? Our four types are **`bg`**, **`text`**, **`icon`**, and **`border`**.

_Example variables_
`--figma-color-`**`bg`**
`--figma-color-`**`text`**

###### Color Role `(optional)`

Colors in our UI have specific meaning, so we’ve organized hues around how they are used, rather than the hue itself. For example, our default accent color is `-brand`, which may shift between blue and purple dependent on context.

_Example variables_
`--figma-color-bg-`**`brand`**
`--figma-color-icon-`**`danger`**

###### Prominence `(optional)`

To create hierarchy and adjust visual emphasis, bg, text, and icon support `-secondary` and `-tertiary`. Similarly, borders come in two flavors — “default” for a border that acts as a divider, and `-strong` for a border used as the outline around a more prominent element (like a text input).

_Example variables_
`--figma-color-text-`**`secondary`**
`--figma-color-border-`**`strong`**

###### Interaction `(optional)`

Some tokens support `-hover` and `-pressed` modifiers for interaction states.

_Example variables_
`--figma-color-bg-brand-`**`pressed`**
`--figma-color-icon-danger-`**`hover`**

##### Color Roles

To create consistent meaning around our colors, we’ve organized hues by color role. These modifiers can be added to any type of color token — so for example, “red text” would be `--figma-color-text-danger`, and a “red background” would be `--figma-color-bg-danger`.

**`-brand`** Our default accent color, which may shift between blue in Figma design and purple in FigJam.

**`-selected`** Light blue or purple fills for the backgrounds of a selected element, or a border around a focused element.

**`-disabled`** Light grey fills for inactive text, buttons, and inputs that a user cannot interact with.

**`-component`** Purple text, icons, and backgrounds for component layer names, as well as features connected to components (like variants)

**`-danger`** Red indicators when there is an error, or something a user should urgently attend to.

**`-warning`** Yellow indicators used to warn a user about a potential problem, such as a missing font.

**`-success`** Green indicators used for confirmation, approval, or when a task has completed.

**`-inverse`** Dark grey / white fills used for elements that need to be “the opposite of the background color”.

#### Frequently Used Tokens

While we have many tokens, there are a handful that are very frequently used, and worth knowing about.

###### Text Colors

**`--figma-color-text`** Our default text color for most titles, tabs, and body text.

**`--figma-color-text-secondary`** Our secondary text color for inactive tabs, labels, timestamps, and other text that needs to be “lighter” in order to create hierarchy.

**`--figma-color-text-tertiary`** Our tertiary text color primarily used for placeholder text (for example in a search input), or for hierarchy below secondary text.

**`--figma-color-text-disabled`** Truly disabled text that a user cannot interact with.

**`--figma-color-text-onbrand`** White text used against a Blue / Purple background (for example, the text in our “Share” button).

**`--figma-color-text-brand`** Blue or purple text used for things like links.

**`--figma-color-text-danger`** Red text used to alert users about an error.

**`--figma-color-text-warning`** Yellow text used to warn users about a potential problem.

**`--figma-color-text-success`** Green text used for confirmation, and approval.

###### Background Colors

**`--figma-color-bg`** Our default white / light grey background fill for most views (like our file browser, editor sidebars, panels, windows, and modals).

**`--figma-color-bg-secondary`** A light grey fill used to create sections on top of a background, as well as for some inputs.

###### Common Hues

**`--figma-color-bg-brand`** Blue or purple fill colors for backgrounds like a blue primary button.

**`--figma-color-bg-danger`** Red fill color behind destructive buttons, and error banners.

**`--figma-color-bg-warning`** Yellow fill color for warning banners

**`--figma-color-bg-success`** Green fill color for confirmation banners.

###### Borders

**`--figma-color-border`** Our default border color for dividers between sections.

**`--figma-color-border-strong`** The darker border color we use for secondary outline buttons.

**`--figma-color-border-selected`** The blue or purple border color we use for focused / selected inputs.

**`--figma-color-border-danger-strong`** The red border color we use around inputs that have an error.

#### Default Token Values

if you are interested in accessing the default values for these tokens, you can get at them by accessing the `<style id="figma-style"/>` tag via JavaScript inside your UI code.

Access default values

```
const styleTagDefinitions = document.getElementById("figma-style").innerHTML;
```

Using this, you can run this directly in your console to log the defaults for the current theme.

Logging defaults of current theme

```
figma.showUI( "<script>console.log(document.getElementById('figma-style').innerHTML)</script>", { themeColors: true });
```
### Accepting Parameters as Input

This page goes over how to accept parameters as input to your plugin. Plugin parameters offer a way to receive user input without building a UI. They can be flexible, fast to develop, and convenient for users.

To support parameter input, there are a few changes you have to make:

1. Add a parameter list to your plugin’s manifest.
2. Add a handler for the `figma.parameters.on('input')` event to provide suggested parameter values.
3. Add a handler for the `figma.on('run')` event to run your plugin with the selected values.

To get started building plugins with parameters, check out these samples in the Figma Plugin Samples repository.

#### Parameter List

To accept parameters, your plugin must define a list of parameters in the manifest. You can either define a single list of parameters on the manifest root, or you can create multiple submenu items, each with its own unique parameter list. A parameter list is an array of parameters that looks something like this:

manifest.json

```
{ "name": "Plugin with parameters", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "code.js", "editorType": [ "figma", "figjam" ], "documentAccess": "dynamic-page", "parameters": [ { "name": "Icon name", "key": "icon-name" }, { "name": "Size", "key": "size", "allowFreeform": true }, { "name": "Color", "key": "color", "allowFreeform": true, "optional": true } ]}
```

Each parameter requires a `name` and a `key`. The `name` is the text that appears in the UI and the `key` is used to uniquely identify the value for that parameter when your plugin is run.

Parameters can optionally set `allowFreeform` and `optional` flags. Freeform parameters (`allowFreeform == true`) allow any value to be entered, not just those suggested by the plugin. Optional parameters are skippable, meaning their values may be undefined when your plugin runs. In the UI, parameters are entered in the order they appear in the manifest, with optional parameters coming last. If optional parameters aren’t last in the manifest, we will throw an error.

By default, any time that a parameter-enabled command is triggered by the user, the parameter entry UI is launched and the user is asked to provide parameter values. This includes all contexts from which a plugin can be run: quick actions, context menus, the desktop app menu, etc.

However, you can make your plugin runnable without parameters by setting `"parameter Only": false` in the manifest for the command. For plugins or commands with `"parameterOnly": false`, users will only be able to provide parameters by pressing tab in quick actions. All other menus will launch your plugin without parameters. It is the responsibility of the plugin to get the necessary information from the user, usually using `show UI`. This can be useful if you want to allow advanced users to quickly enter parameter values, while allowing other users to use a richer UI created by your plugin.

#### Suggestions

Your plugin can dynamically provide suggestions as a user types in values for parameters. To enable this, your plugin is launched in “query mode,” during which it can read from the document, and make network requests, but can’t make changes to the document or display visible UI. The Capital sample plugin demonstrates how to make network requests in a plugin that accepts parameters. For a more advanced example, refer to the Trivia sample plugin.

Users enter parameters one at a time in quick actions. Every time the user makes a change, we clear out old suggestions and trigger an event in the plugin. Plugins provide updated suggestions by handling the `figma.parameters.on('input')` event and calling `set Suggestions` on the object passed in.

Suggestions represent valid parameter values. For freeform parameters, any value can be entered, so these suggestions enable convenient autocompletions. But, for all other parameters, these suggestions are the only valid values accepted for that parameter. Users can’t progress to the next parameter until they select one of these valid values.

Here is an example of what this looks like in practice:

Filtering suggestions

```
figma.parameters.on( 'input', ({ parameters, key, query, result }: ParameterInputEvent) => { switch (key) { case 'icon': const icons = [ 'menu', 'settings', 'search', 'angle', 'checkbox', 'logout' ] result.setSuggestions(icons.filter(s => s.includes(query))) break ... default: return } })
```

You have a lot of flexibility in the suggestions you choose to present. You can filter suggestions using the simple function shown above, or you could implement a more complex ‘fuzzy’ search, among other options.

The `set Suggestions` API also allows you to display icons and associate hidden metadata with each suggestion. With metadata, you can pass around useful information like node IDs while still displaying user friendly suggestion text.

For more details, see `set Suggestions` and `set Error`.

#### Run

After all parameters have been entered, your plugin is run via the `figma.on('run')` event. The selected parameter values are passed as an input to the run event handler. This event is called on all plugin runs, not just plugins with parameters, making it a convenient place to put all of your top level plugin code.

Run plugin with parameters

```
figma.on('run', ({ command, parameters }: RunEvent) => { switch (command) { case "resize": handleResize(parameters.width, parameters.height) break case "move": handleMove(parameters.dx, parameters.dy) break ... }})
```

The `'run'` event also signals the end of “query mode”, which means you can start using all normal plugin APIs. It is possible that your plugin will be run with parameters, but never enter “query mode”. This can happen, for example, when using the “Run last plugin” shortcut.

The `'run'` event is always fired when a plugin is first launched, even when the user has not used the parameters UI. If the user did not use the parameter UI the `parameters` property is set to `undefined` rather than a map of parameter values.

This is especially useful for plugins and submenu items that contain `"parameterOnly": false`. For such plugins, you can always use the `'run'` event as an entry point to your plugin logic, and then check if `parameters === undefined` to check if the parameter UI was used.

### Making Network Requests

This guide describes how to make basic network requests, test network access, and specify the scope of your plugin's network access. As a best practice, Figma recommends that your plugin only allows domains that are needed for your plugin to work.

In practice, you first develop your plugin and implement all the required network requests. Then, before publishing, you can use the instructions in this guide to specify access to only the domains used by your plugin.

- Make network requests
- Test network access
- Specify network access

---

#### Make network requests

To make network requests from within a plugin, such as calls to your own API or to request resources from a server, use Figma's Fetch API. The Figma Fetch API is used in a similar way to the WhatWG Fetch API that is standard in most browsers.

This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the basics of creating Figma plugins. If you’re new to developing plugins, check out the Build your first plugin course — you can copy and paste the code from this guide into the plugin you build.

The following code sample makes a request to an external API and returns the JSON response to the console.

Fetch to the console

```
(async () => { const response = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/get?success=true') const json = await response.json() console.log(JSON.stringify(json.args, null, 2)) figma.closePlugin()})()
```

By adding a text node to the canvas, we can deliver content from the response directly into a Figma file.

Fetch to the canvas

```
(async () => { const response = await fetch("https://httpbin.org/get?success=true"); const json = await response.json(); const textNode = figma.createText(); await figma.loadFontAsync(textNode.fontName as FontName); // success=true! textNode.characters = JSON.stringify(json.args, null, 2); figma.closePlugin();})();
```

Because plugins run inside a browser environment, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies apply. Plugin iframes have a `null` origin. This means that they will only be able to call APIs with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (i.e., those that allow access from any origin).

Previously, to make network requests within a plugin, you had to implement an iframe to handle sending requests and receiving data. While plugins implemented this way will continue to function normally and do not need to be modified, we recommend using the simpler Fetch API approach.

---

#### Test network access

After you've implemented network requests in your plugin (e.g. calling an API or getting images from a server), test the impact of limiting your plugin's network access. Then, use the results of your testing to build the list of domains you need to appropriately limit network access.

To test the impact of limiting your plugin's network access:

1. In your plugin's `manifest.json`, add the `networkAccess` key with the `allowedDomains` property set to `["none"]`.

Manifest.json

```
{ "name": "MyPlugin", "id": "737805260747778092", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "code.js", "ui": "ui.html", "networkAccess": { "allowedDomains": ["none"] }}
```

2. In Figma, try to use your plugin as normal. In the developer console, note any content-security policy (CSP) errors. For example, if the request in Make network requests was blocked:

CSP error

```
Refused to connect to 'https://httpsbin.org/' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src data:".Note that 'connect-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.
```

3. As you identify CSP errors, follow the Limit network access steps to remove `"none"` and add the domains that your plugin requires to the `allowedDomains` list.


When you're confident that all the required domains are listed in `allowedDomains` and you no longer encounter CSP errors, testing is complete.

---

#### Specify network access

To specify a list of domains that your plugin is allowed to access, you update the plugin's `manifest.json` file:

1. In your plugin's `manifest.json`, add the `networkAccess` key. `networkAccess` has the following properties: `allowedDomains`, `reasoning`, and `devAllowedDomains`.

Manifest.json

```
{ "name": "MyPlugin", "id": "737805260747778092", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "code.js", "ui": "ui.html", "networkAccess": { "allowedDomains": [], "reasoning": "", "devAllowedDomains": [] }}
```

2. Add domains to the `allowedDomains` list. The domains that you add to the list should correspond to the domains that you are making requests to. This includes any requests you make for external resources using methods like createImageAsnyc().

For example, to limit a plugin's access to only the `httpbin.org` domain used in Make network requests:

Manifest.json

```
{ "name": "MyPlugin", "id": "737805260747778092", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "code.js", "ui": "ui.html", "networkAccess": { "allowedDomains": ["httpbin.org"], "reasoning": "", "devAllowedDomains": [] }}
```

If the only endpoint the plugin uses is `/get`, make the string in the `allowedDomains` list even more granular:

Manifest.json

```
{ "name": "MyPlugin", "id": "737805260747778092", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "code.js", "ui": "ui.html", "networkAccess": { "allowedDomains": ["httpbin.org/get"], "reasoning": "", "devAllowedDomains": [] }}
```

This way, no unexpected requests can be made to other endpoints on the domain.

There are several patterns that can be used to specify domains for `allowedDomains`. For a complete list, see Plugin Manifest. You can also specify:

- `["none"]`: `none` is a special keyword that prevents all network access. Use this if your plugin doesn't make any network requests.

- `["*"]`: `*` is a special character that permits your plugin to access any domain. If your plugin includes `*` in `allowedDomains`, then `reasoning` is required.


3. For `reasoning`, provide a brief explanation for the access scope permitted by `allowedDomains`. When you publish your plugin, this explanation is visible on your plugin's Community page along with the list of allowed domains.

For example:

Manifest.json

```
{ "name": "MyPlugin", "id": "737805260747778092", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "code.js", "ui": "ui.html", "networkAccess": { "allowedDomains": ["httpbin.org/get"], "reasoning": "MyPlugin queries httpbin.org/get for example responses.", "devAllowedDomains": [] }}
```

4. If you need to access a local or development web server to build your plugin, add its domain(s) to the `devAllowedDomains` list. The domains that you add to the list should correspond to the local URL(s) for your development server. If you want to access a local or development web server in `allowedDomains`, then `reasoning` is required.

For example:

Manifest.json

```
{ "name": "MyPlugin", "id": "737805260747778092", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "code.js", "ui": "ui.html", "networkAccess": { "allowedDomains": ["httpbin.org/get"], "reasoning": "MyPlugin queries httpbin.org/get for example responses.", "devAllowedDomains": ["http://localhost:3000"] }}
```

5. Save the changes to your manifest.


After `networkAccess` is implemented, Figma enforces the list of domains that you gave for `allowedDomains`. If a request originates from your plugin to a domain not in `allowedDomains`, Figma blocks the request and throws a content-security policy (CSP) error.

For example, if our plugin attempts to make a request to `httpbin.org/post`, we get the following error:

CSP error

```
Refused to connect to 'https://httpbin.org/post' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src data:". Note that 'connect-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.
```

### Working with Images

Figma plugins are a powerful way to add and manipulate images in Figma files. In the following sections, we show how to add images to your Figma files and modify images within your plugin.

In this guide, you'll learn how to create a plugin that can:

- Add images
- Manipulate images

This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the basics of creating Figma plugins. If you’re new to developing plugins, check out the Build your first plugin course — you can copy and paste the code from this guide into the plugin you build.

---

#### Add images

In this section, we’ll use a plugin to add images to a Figma file. We can do this a couple of ways:

- Add an image from a known source such as an s3 bucket or web server.
- Add an image from user input.

To use a plugin to add images to a Figma file, an image must be:

- `PNG`, `JPG`, or `GIF` format.
- A maximum of 4096 x 4096 px.
- Available to the Figma plugin. For example, a server’s Cross-Origin Resource Sharing(CORS) configuration can sometimes block requests for image files. To avoid network requests altogether, you can include images in your plugin as Base64-encoded data.

##### Add an image with a known size

The following code sample gets an image from a URL, and inserts a rectangle with the image as a fill.

Render image of known size

```
figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync( <figma.widget.Image src="https://picsum.photos/200/300" width={200} height={300} />)
```

Render image of known size (without JSX)

```
figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync( figma.widget.h( figma.widget.Image, { src: "https://picsum.photos/200/300", width: 200, height: 300 } ))
```

##### Add an image from a known source

The following code sample gets an image from a URL, creates a rectangle, and then renders the image by adding the image as a fill to the rectangle.

Render image in file

```
// Get an image from a URL.figma.createImageAsync( 'https://picsum.photos/200').then(async (image: Image) => { // Create a rectangle that's the same dimensions as the image. const node = figma.createRectangle() const { width, height } = await image.getSizeAsync() node.resize(width, height) // Render the image by filling the rectangle. node.fills = [ { type: 'IMAGE', imageHash: image.hash, scaleMode: 'FILL' } ]})
```

Here’s an explanation of what the code is doing:

1. To get image data into our plugin, we use the `figma.create Image Async` method. The method returns a Promise that contains an image object.
2. Because `createImageAsync` returns a Promise, we use `.then()` to take action on the image returned by the method.
3. In Figma, images don’t exist on their own — images are rendered by adding an image as a fill to a node., we create a rectangle node (`figma.createRectangle`) that will be used to render the image.
4. The image object returned by `createImageAsync` has a built-in method named `getSizeAsync`. Rather than hardcoding dimensions for the image into the plugin, we use `getSizeAsync` to get the dimensions of the image we requested in the first step. Then, we set the rectangle node to those dimensions.
5. To render the image onto the canvas, we add the image to the rectangle node using the `.fills` property. Then, we use `imageHash` to provide the hashed version of the image, `image.hash`, that was returned by `createImageAsync`.

This code sample hardcodes a URL for `createImageAsync`. For an example that allows different URLs, check out the next section.

##### Add an image from user input

The following code sample expands the previous method. Rather than hardcoding an image URL for `createImageAsync`, we’re going accept user input from the quick actions menu using plugin parameters. To implement parameters, we need to update our plugin's `manifest.json` file, as well as the plugin code.

###### manifest.json

To accept user input, we add the `parameters` property to our plugin’s `manifest.json` file:

Modified manifest.json

```
{ "name": "Example Name", ..., "parameters": [ { "name": "URL", "key": "url", "description": "A URL for a PNG, JPG, or GIF no larger than 4096x4096 px." } ]}
```

The `parameters` property lets us define a parameter that will store the URL provided by the user.

###### code.ts

To handle the user’s input, we do a few things to the code for our plugin:

- Add `figma.parameters.on('input')` so that the plugin can listen for input from the quick actions menu.
- Add `figma.on('run')` to pass the URL from the user into our plugin’s existing code.
- Wrap the original `figma.createImageAsync(...).then(...)` call in a function named `startPluginWithParameters`, which takes the user’s URL from our parameters as input.
- In `figma.createImageAsync(...)`, we replace the hardcoded URL with a reference to `parameters.url`.

Render a user-provided image in a file

```
// Listen for input from the quick actions menu.figma.parameters.on('input', ({query, result}: ParameterInputEvent) => { result.setSuggestions([query, 'https://picsum.photos/256', 'https://picsum.photos/512'])})// When input is done, run the plugin with the user input as a parameter.figma.on('run', ({parameters}: RunEvent) => { startPluginWithParameters(parameters)})// Start the plugin with parameters. Parameters are defined in manifest.json.async function startPluginWithParameters(parameters: ParameterValues) { try { await figma.createImageAsync( parameters.url ).then(async (image: Image) => { const node = figma.createRectangle() const { width, height } = await image.getSizeAsync() node.resize(width, height) // Your image is added to the canvas node.fills = [ { type: 'IMAGE', imageHash: image.hash, scaleMode: 'FILL' } ] }) // If there's an error, notify the user. } catch (error) { figma.notify(error) } finally { figma.closePlugin() }}
```

Now that you can add images to a Figma file using a plugin, you’re ready to start making changes to those images. To learn about manipulating images with a plugin, check out the next section.

---

#### Manipulate images

In this section we will look at how to manipulate images within a Figma plugin. We will learn how to retrieve an image from a document, how to decode the image to manipulate its bytes, and how to write a modified image back to the document. As a concrete example, we will show you how to invert the colors of an image.

As you probably know, images in Figma are stored inside the **fills** of an object. So we first need to retrieve the fills off the current selection.

Retrieve fills from current selection

```
async function invertImages(node) { const newFills = [] for (const paint of node.fills) { if (paint.type === 'IMAGE') { // Get the (encoded) bytes for this image. const image = figma.getImageByHash(paint.imageHash) const bytes = await image.getBytesAsync() // TODO: Do something with the bytes! } } node.fills = newFills}// Assume the current selection has fills.// In an actual plugin, this won't necessarily be true!const selected = figma.currentPage.selection[0] as GeometryMixininvertImages(selected)
```

Calling `get Bytes Async` returns the raw bytes of the image, as it is stored on disk. This can be useful if you want to download the image or upload it somewhere else. However, in our case, we want to manipulate the image pixel-by-pixel, as a matrix of RGBA samples. Doing so requires **decoding** the image.

This could be done by importing some image decoding library. Instead, what we'll do is ask the browser to decode the image for us. We can do this by putting the image in a `<canvas>`element which will give us access to the `getImageData` and `putImageData` functions provided by browsers.

You may recall from the execution model section that you will need to create an `<iframe>` to access browser APIs. We'll do that later: for now, here is our extended plugin code that sends the original image to the (yet-to-be-implemented) worker, receives a modified image, and replaces the image fill:

code.ts: Send image data to UI

```
async function invertImages(node) { const newFills = [] for (const paint of node.fills) { if (paint.type === 'IMAGE') { // Get the (encoded) bytes for this image. const image = figma.getImageByHash(paint.imageHash) const bytes = await image.getBytesAsync() // Create an invisible iframe to act as a "worker" which // will do the task of decoding and send us a message // when it's done. figma.showUI(__html__, { visible: false }) // Send the raw bytes of the file to the worker. figma.ui.postMessage(bytes) // Wait for the worker's response. const newBytes = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => { figma.ui.onmessage = value => resolve(value) }) // Create a new paint for the new image. const newPaint = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(paint)) newPaint.imageHash = figma.createImage(newBytes).hash newFills.push(newPaint) } } node.fills = newFills}
```

Now we will implement the worker that will actually decode, modify, and encode the image. It's possible to render UI elements directly in the call to `figma.showUI()`, but for this example the code needs to be in a separate file referred to by the `ui` section of the manifest. This worker will need to listen to messages from the plugin code and respond with a message back once it's accomplished its task. We will implement `encode` and `decode` later.

ui.html: Decode, modify, and encode image

```
<script> // Create an event handler to receive messages from the main // thread. window.onmessage = async (event) => { // Just get the bytes directly from the pluginMessage since // that's the only type of message we'll receive in this // plugin. In more complex plugins, you'll want to check the // type of the message. const bytes = event.data.pluginMessage const canvas = document.createElement('canvas') const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d') const imageData = await decode(canvas, ctx, bytes) const pixels = imageData.data // Do the actual work of inverting the colors. for (let i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) { pixels[i + 0] = 255 - pixels[i + 0] pixels[i + 1] = 255 - pixels[i + 1] pixels[i + 2] = 255 - pixels[i + 2] // Don't invert the alpha channel. } const newBytes = await encode(canvas, ctx, imageData) window.parent.postMessage({pluginMessage: newBytes}, '*') }</script>
```

As you can see in the example above, we create a `<canvas>` object. The handle for the data backing `<canvas>` is called a context and is obtained with `canvas.getContext('2d')`. The context allows us to retrieve and write Image Data objects. `ImageData` objects have a `.data`field which is an array containing the colors of each sample (or pixel) in the image in sequence, stored as `[R, G, B, A, R, G, B, A, ...]`. To invert the colors in the image, we take each color channel `value` and replace it with `255 - value`.

To learn more about how `RGBA` and `RGB` color values are handled by Figma and plugins, see: RGB/RGBA

Provided below are the implementations of the `encode` and `decode` functions.

Encode and decode images

// Encoding an image is also done by sticking pixels in an// HTML canvas and by asking the canvas to serialize it into// an actual PNG file via canvas.toBlob().async function encode(canvas, ctx, imageData) { ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0) return await new Promise((resolve, reject) => { canvas.toBlob(blob => { const reader = new FileReader() reader.onload = () => resolve(new Uint8Array(reader.result)) reader.onerror = () => reject(new Error('Could not read from blob')) reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob) }) })}// Decoding an image can be done by sticking it in an HTML// canvas, as we can read individual pixels off the canvas.async function decode(canvas, ctx, bytes) { const url = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([bytes])) const image = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => { const img = new Image() img.onload = () => resolve(img) img.onerror = () => reject() img.src = url }) canvas.width = image.width canvas.height = image.height ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0) const imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, image.width, image.height) return imageData}
```

The example above won't work for GIFs, which are more like video files than image files. In fact, `<canvas>` doesn't really support GIFs. You will need to use a third-party Javascript library capable of encoding and decoding GIFs.

### Working with Text

**Note:** This guide covers details about using the Plugin API to work with text in Figma, such as loading fonts and handling characters with mixed styles. If you're looking for information about handling rich text in annotation labels and component descriptions, try Working with Rich Text.

When working with text nodes, there are a lot of things to consider:

- Mixed styles
- Loading fonts
- Missing fonts

##### Mixed styles

Many text properties can be set on individual characters. For that reason, you will find that many of text properties can return the special value `figma.mixed` if there are characters in the text with different values for that property. **Always consider that a text property could have mixed values**.

Suppose there is a text node that contains the text "**hello** world". Below are some properties and functions for retrieving the font name:

Retrieving font name

```
// Output: figma.mixedtextNode.fontName// Output: { family: 'Inter', style: 'Bold' }textNode.getRangeFontName(0, 5)// Output: { family: 'Inter', style: 'Regular' }textNode.getRangeFontName(5, 11)// Output: figma.mixedtextNode.getRangeFontName(4, 6)/*Output:[ { characters: "hello", start: 0, end: 5, fontName: { family: 'Inter', style: 'Bold' }, }, { characters: " world", start: 5, end: 11, fontName: { family: 'Inter', style: 'Regular' }, }]*/textNode.getStyledTextSegments(['fontName'])
```

In general, we recommend using text properties such as `font Size`, `font Name`, etc... when getting / setting styles for the entire text node, or checking if there are mixed values. Use the `getRange*` and `setRange*` functions for getting / setting styles for a specific range of characters. If you want to see what the property values are and which characters they apply to, use `get Styled Text Segments`.

##### Loading fonts

The important thing with text is that **changing the content of a text node requires its font to be loaded** and that **fonts are not always available**. If you attempt to change, say, `fontSize` without first loading the font for that text node, the plugin will throw an exception.

When setting the `.fontName` or `.textStyleId` property, you do only need to load the new font. When setting any other property that affects text layout, you need to load all the fonts that the text node already use. This includes the following properties and functions:

- `characters`
- `fontSize`
- `fontName`
- `textStyleId`
- `textCase`
- `textDecoration`
- `letterSpacing`
- `leadingTrim`
- `lineHeight`
- `setRangeFontSize()`
- `setRangeFontName()`
- `setRangeTextCase()`
- `setRangeTextDecoration()`
- `setRangeLetterSpacing()`
- `setRangeLineHeight()`
- `setRangeTextStyleIdAsync()`

You do **not** need to load a font in order to change properties that only affects colors and strokes, such as `.fills`, `.fillStyleId`, `.strokes`, `.strokeWeight`, `.strokeAlign`, `.strokeStyleId`, `.dashPattern`.

Loading a font is done via `figma.loadFontAsync(fontname)`.

For text nodes that contain a single font, you can call `figma.loadFontAsync(node.fontName)`. For nodes that contain multiple fonts you can use the `getRangeAllFontNames` API to get all the fonts that the node is using. As an example:

Loading font names

```
await Promise.all( node.getRangeAllFontNames(0, node.characters.length) .map(figma.loadFontAsync))
```

##### Missing fonts

You will need to check `text.hasMissingFont` before loading a font. If your plugin works with text, do not to ignore this. While less frequent during testing, it's very common in the real world that your users will attempt to run your plugin in a file with missing fonts.

**How text works in Figma (and why you need to load fonts)**

When a user types into a text node or changes one of its properties, we generate a path to represent the text, and store it along with the text node. This way, sharing a file (e.g. to a client) allows them to see the design as-is. _Even if they don't have the fonts installed on their system_! However, this means that even when a text node looks fine, it may not be editable.

This is one of the many subtleties that Figma needs to do to uphold the core value proposition of a cloud tool: that everyone looking at the same file always sees the same thing.

In addition to this, a font file is not always loaded in memory even when it is available from the user's local machine. This is because font files can be big, there could be many of them, and they aren't needed until text is edited. This makes loading them at startup time potentially very expensive. As such, calling `loadFontAsync` is necessary to ensure that the font is available.

##### Unloaded fonts vs. missing fonts

It is important to note that unloaded fonts are not related to missing fonts. All fonts are unloaded until your plugin loads them by calling `loadFontAsync`. Missing fonts are the fonts not available to the user. For example, someone created a text node and this user does not have have the font used in this text node installed on their computer.

##### Text and variables in Figma

For additional control of styling and layout, you can bind variables to text and substrings. To learn more about typography variables, see Working with Variables.

### Working with Variables

Variables in Figma design store reusable values that can be applied to all kinds of design properties and prototyping actions. They help save time and effort when building designs, managing design systems, and creating complex prototyping flows.

Use your plugin to interact with variables in Figma, including creating and reading variables. The Plugin API provides methods using the `figma.variables` global object to interact with variables.

This guide contains the following sections:

- Get variable collections and variables
- Create variable collections and variables
- Nodes and bound variables
- Typography variables
- Helpers
- Samples

This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the basics of creating Figma plugins. If you’re new to developing plugins, check out the Build your first plugin course — you can copy and paste the code from this guide into the plugin you build.

---

#### Get variable collections and variables

Use one of the following methods to let your plugin get variables and variable collections.

##### [getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-variables/#getlocalvariablecollectionsasync)

The `figma.variables.getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync` method returns all local variable collections in the current file.

Example usage:

```
const localCollections = await figma.variables.getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync();
```

##### [getVariableCollectionByIdAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-variables-getvariablecollectionbyidasync/)

The `figma.variables.getVariableCollectionByIdAsync` method finds a variable collection by ID. If not found or the provided ID is invalid, returns `null`.

Example usage:

```
const collection = await figma.variables.getVariableCollectionByIdAsync('VariableCollectionId:257c3beb2/57:13');
```

##### [getLocalVariablesAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-variables-getlocalvariablesasync/)

The `figma.variables.getLocalVariablesAsync` method returns all local variables in the current file, optionally filtering by resolved type.

Example usage:

```
const localVariables = await figma.variables.getLocalVariablesAsync('STRING'); // filters local variables by the 'STRING' type
```

##### [getVariableByIdAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-variables-getvariablebyidasync/)

The `figma.variables.getVariableByIdAsync` method finds a variable by ID. If not found or the provided ID is invalid, returns `null`.

Example usage:

```
const variable = await figma.variables.getVariableByIdAsync(variableId);
```

---

#### Create variable collections and variables

Use one of the following methods to create variables or variable collections.

##### [createVariableCollection](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-variables-createvariablecollection/)

To create a variable collection, use the `figma.variables.createVariableCollection`method.

Example usage:

```
const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection('Example Collection');
```

##### [createVariable](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-variables-createvariable/)

To create a variable, use the `figma.variables.createVariable` method.

Example usage:

```
const variable = figma.variables.createVariable( 'ExampleVariableName', collection, 'STRING');
```

This example creates a variable with the name `ExampleVariableName` of the `STRING` type. The variable is created inside a collection with the ID `57:13`.

---

#### Nodes and bound variables

For a variable to apply its value to a node, the variable must be bound to the node. In the context of the Figma user interface, when a variable is applied to a node (for example, if you set a color variable for a stroke on a rectangle), the alias for that variable is captured in the `boundVariables` property of the node.

You can also use the Plugin API to bind variables to nodes with our helper methods, and the `setBoundVariable` method that is available for many types of nodes. For a list of the supported nodes, see `set Bound Variable`.

To use `setBoundVariable`, you must provide a valid bindable field and the variable that you want to bind to the field. The variable that you're binding must match the data type of the field. For example, the `SHAPE_WITH_TEXT` node has an `opacity` property that accepts numbers. In this case, the variable you bind to `opacity` must be a number variable.

The following example creates a variable collection and variable, and then applies that variable to an example node.

setBoundVariable example

```
const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("example-collection")const widthVariable = figma.variables.createVariable("width-variable", collection, "FLOAT")const exampleNode = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("1:4")// Simple fields can be bound using setBoundVariableexampleNode.setBoundVariable("width", widthVariable)
```

To get the aliases for variables that are bound to a node, use the `boundVariables` property on nodes.

Get bound variables example

```
const exampleNode = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("1:4")const exampleNodeVariables = exampleNode.boundVariables/* Example boundVariables object: { "strokes": [ { "type": "VARIABLE_ALIAS", "id": "VariableID:1:7" } ] }*/
```

To unbind or remove a variable from a node, set the bound field to `null`.

Unbind a variable example

```
const exampleNode = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("1:4")// Simple fields can be unbound using setBoundVariable and nullexampleNode.setBoundVariable("width", null)
```

To learn more about binding variables, check out the code samples.

---

#### Typography variables

Typography variables are used to control complex type across your Figma files and design systems. You can use typography variables to manage everything from typeface to the spacing between characters and paragraphs.

Variables can be used to control text styling for `TextNodes`, `TextSublayers` (substrings of styled text), and `TextStyles`. Paragraph spacing and indentation cannot be applied to `TextSublayers`.

The following properties are bindable:

- **`fontFamily`**: Accepts string variables. The value for the variable must correspond to a font name, such as `Inter`.
- **`fontStyle`**: Accepts string variables. The value for the variable must map to a valid style for the font. The specific style values depend on the font you are using. For example, when `fontFamily` is `Inter`, `fontStyle` can be set to values such as `Light`, `Regular`, or `Semi Bold`, among other styles supported by the font.
- **`fontWeight`**: Accepts number variables. If the number value doesn't correspond to a valid weight for the font, the closest valid weight is used.
- **`lineHeight`**: Accepts number variables.
- **`letterSpacing`**: Accepts number variables.
- **`paragraphSpacing`**: Accepts number variables. Not valid for substrings.
- **`paragraphIndent`**: Accepts number variables. Not valid for substrings.

**Apply typography variables**

To apply typography variables to a `TextNode`, use the `setBoundVariable` method as you would with other variables.

TextNode.setBoundVariable example

```
const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("example-collection")const weightVariable = figma.variables.createVariable("weight-variable", collection, "FLOAT")const exampleTextNode = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("1:4")// Typography variables can be bound using setBoundVariableexampleTextNode.setBoundVariable("fontWeight", weightVariable)
```

To apply typography variables to a substring, use the `setRangeBoundVariable` method that is available for `TextNodes`.

TextNode.setRangeBoundVariable example

```
const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("example-collection")const weightVariable = figma.variables.createVariable("weight-variable", collection, "FLOAT")const exampleTextNode = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("1:4")// Typography variables can be bound to ranges of text with setRangeBoundVariableexampleTextNode.setRangeBoundVariable(0, 5, "fontWeight", weightVariable)
```

To apply typography variables to a `TextStyle`, use the `setBoundVariable` method, similar to how you bind typography variables to `TextNodes`.

TextStyle.setBoundVariable example

```
const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("example-collection")const weightVariable = figma.variables.createVariable("weight-variable", collection, "FLOAT")// Uses the first available local style as an exampleconst localTextStyles = await figma.getLocalTextStylesAsync()const exampleTextStyle = localTextStyles[0]// Typography variables can be bound using setBoundVariableexampleTextStyle.setBoundVariable("fontWeight", weightVariable)
```

**Get typography variables**

To get the aliases for typography variables that are bound to a `TextNode`, use the `boundVariables` property of the `TextNode`.

Get bound typography variables example

```
const exampleTextNode = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("1:4")const exampleTextNodeVariables = exampleTextNode.boundVariables
```

To get the typography variables for segments of text, use the `TextNode.getStyledTextSegments` method with `boundVariables`.

TextNode.getStyledTextSegments example

```
const exampleTextNode = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("1:4")exampleTextNode.getStyledTextSegments(['boundVariables'])/* Example output[ { characters: "hello", start: 0, end: 5, boundVariables: { fontFamily: { type: "VARIABLE_ALIAS", id: "VariableID:1:7" } } }, { characters: " world", start: 5, end: 11, boundVariables: { fontFamily: { type: "VARIABLE_ALIAS", id: "VariableID:2:8" } } }]*/
```

You can also use the `TextNode.getRangeBoundVariable` method to get a specific bound variable based on the character range and field (`fontWeight`, for example).

TextNode.getRangeBoundVariable example

```
const exampleTextNode = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("1:4")// Get typography variables that are bound to ranges of text with getRangeBoundVariableexampleTextNode.getRangeBoundVariable(0, 5, "fontWeight")
```

To get typography variables that are bound to `TextStyles`, use the `boundVariables`property of the `TextStyle`, similar to `TextNodes`.

Get bound typography variables for TextStyle example

```
// Uses the first available local style as an exampleconst localTextStyles = await figma.getLocalTextStylesAsync()const exampleTextStyle = localTextStyles[0]const exampleTextStyleVariables = exampleTextStyle.boundVariables
```

**Remove typography variables**

To unbind or remove a typography variable, set the bound field to `null`.

Unbind a typography variable example

```
const exampleTextNode = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("1:4")// Simple fields can be unbound using setBoundVariable and nullexampleTextNode.setBoundVariable("fontWeight", null)
```

To learn more about binding typography variables, check out the code samples.

#### Helpers

The `figma.variables` global object also provides some helper methods to make certain operations easier.

##### [createVariableAlias](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-variables/#createvariablealias)

The `figma.variables.createVariableAlias` method is a helper function to create a variable alias. Variable aliases are used to bind variables to other variables, or to bind variables to various properties on a node or style.

##### [createVariableAliasByIdAsync(variableId)](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-variables/#createvariablealiasbyidasync)

The `figma.variables.createVariableAliasByIdAsync(variableId)` method is a helper function that accepts a variable ID and returns an alias that references that variable.

##### [setBoundVariableForPaint](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-variables/#setboundvariableforpaint)

The `figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint` method is a helper function to bind a variable to a SolidPaint.

##### [setBoundVariableForEffect](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-variables/#setboundvariableforeffect)

The `figma.variables.setBoundVariableForEffect` method is a helper function to bind a variable to an Effect.

##### [setBoundVariableForLayoutGrid](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-variables/#setboundvariableforlayoutgrid)

The `figma.variables.setBoundVariableForLayoutGrid` method is a helper function to bind a variable to a LayoutGrid.

##### [importVariableByKeyAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-variables/#importvariablebykeyasync)

The `figma.variables.importVariableByKeyAsync` method loads a variable from the team library.

---

#### Samples

This section contains some functional plugin samples that use variables.

##### Example: Authoring a new variable collection

This example creates a new variable collection with two modes, and a color variable that defines a value for each of those two modes.

authoring.js

```
const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("new-collection")collection.renameMode(collection.modes[0].modeId, "light")const colorVariable = figma.variables.createVariable("color-variable", collection, "COLOR")// rename our new variable and collection because naming is hard!colorVariable.name = "text-primary"collection.name = "semantic colors"const lightModeId = collection.modes[0].modeIdconst darkModeId = collection.addMode("dark")// Sets the color to #000 in light mode and #fff in dark modecolorVariable.setValueForMode(lightModeId, {r: 0, g: 0, b: 0})colorVariable.setValueForMode(darkModeId, {r: 1, g: 1, b: 1})
```

##### Example: Determining if a node is bound to a variable

Variables consumed by a given node are enumerated in the `boundVariables` map.

detect-if-bound.js

```
const rectangle = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync(rectangleId)// rectangle.width is a numberif (rectangle.boundVariables['width'] !== undefined) { // Width fields can only have one bound variable, but fills and strokes might have multiple. const widthVariableId = rectangle.boundVariables['width'].id const widthVariable = await figma.variables.getVariableByIdAsync(widthVariableId) // At this point we know that `widthVariable` is bound to the `width` property of `rectangle`. assert(widthVariable.resolveForConsumer(rectangle).value === rectangle.width)}
```

##### Example: Binding a variable to a node or style

Whether binding to a node or style, the procedure is roughly the same.

binding.js

```
const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("new-collection")const widthVariable = figma.variables.createVariable("width-variable", collection, "FLOAT")const colorVariable = figma.variables.createVariable("color-variable", collection, "COLOR")const node = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync(...)// Simple fields can be bound via setBoundVariablenode.setBoundVariable('width', widthVariable)const fillsCopy = clone(node.fills)// Fills and strokes must be set via their immutable arraysfillsCopy[0] = figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint(fillsCopy[0], 'color', colorVariable)node.fills = fillsCopyconst style = await figma.getStyleByIdAsync(...)const paintsCopy = clone(style.paints)paintsCopy[0] = figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint(paintsCopy[0], 'color', colorVariable)style.paints = paintsCopy// Effects and LayoutGrids must also be set by their immutable arraysconst radiusVariable = figma.variables.createVariable("radius-variable", collection, "FLOAT")const effectsCopy = clone(node.effects)effectsCopy[0] = figma.variables.setBoundVariableForEffect(effectsCopy[0], 'radius', radiusVariable)node.effects = effectsCopyconst countVar = figma.variables.createVariable("count-variable", collection, "FLOAT")const layoutGridsCopy = clone(node.layoutGrids)layoutGridsCopy[0] = figma.variables.setBoundVariableForLayoutGrid(layoutGridsCopy[0], 'count', countVar)node.layoutGrids = layoutGridsCopy
```

##### Example: Binding a variable to a variant property

This sample binds a string variable to the variant property on a `Instance Node`

code.js

```
const instanceNode = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync(...);const stringVariable = await figma.variables.getVariableByIdAsync(...);node.setProperties({ "variantPropName": figma.variables.createVariableAlias(stringVariable)})// To clearnode.setProperties({ "variantPropName": "Default", // or other string value})
```

##### Example: Binding a variable to a text node

This sample binds a font family variable to text node.

code.js

```
(async () => { // Setup variables const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("new-collection") const modeId = collection.modes[0].modeId const fontFamilyVar = figma.variables.createVariable("fontFamily", collection, "STRING") fontFamilyVar.setValueForMode(modeId, "Roboto") // Load necessary fonts await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: "Inter", style: "Regular" }) // current font await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: "Roboto", style: "Regular" }) // new font // Create text node const text = figma.createText() text.characters = "Hello world!" // Apply variables text.setBoundVariable("fontFamily", fontFamilyVar)})()
```

##### Example: Binding a variable to a text style

This sample binds a font family variable to a text style.

code.js

```
(async () => { // Setup variables const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("new-collection") const modeId = collection.modes[0].modeId const fontFamilyVar = figma.variables.createVariable("fontFamily", collection, "STRING") fontFamilyVar.setValueForMode(modeId, "Roboto") // Load necessary fonts await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: "Inter", style: "Regular" }) // current font await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: "Roboto", style: "Regular" }) // new font // Create style const textStyle = figma.createTextStyle() // Create text node const text = figma.createText() text.characters = "Hello world!" text.setTextStyleIdAsync(textStyle.id) // Apply variables textStyle.setBoundVariable("fontFamily", fontFamilyVar) console.log(textStyle.boundVariables) // Output: // { // fontFamily: [{ // type: "VARIABLE_ALIAS", // variableId: fontFamilyVar.id // }] // }})()
```

##### Example: Binding a variable to a text substring

This example binds font family and font style variables to a substring of text.

code.js

```
(async () => { // Setup variables const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("new-collection") const modeId = collection.modes[0].modeId const fontStyleVar = figma.variables.createVariable("fontFamily", collection, "STRING") fontStyleVar.setValueForMode(modeId, "Bold") // Load necessary fonts await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: "Inter", style: "Regular" }) // current font await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: "Inter", style: "Bold" }) // new font // Create text node const text = figma.createText() text.characters = "Hello world!" // Apply variables text.setRangeBoundVariable(0, 5, "fontStyle", fontStyleVar) console.log(text.getRangeBoundVariable(0, 5, "fontStyle")) // Output: // { // type: "VARIABLE_ALIAS", // variableId: fontStyleVar.id // } console.log(text.getRangeBoundVariable(0, 6, "fontStyle")) // Output: // Symbol(figma.mixed) console.log(text.getStyledTextSegments(["boundVariables", "fontName"])) // Output: // [ // { // characters: "Hello", // start: 0, // end: 5, // fontName: { family: "Inter", style: "Bold" }, // boundVariables: { // fontStyle: { type: "Variable_ALIAS", variableId: fontStyleVar.id } // } // }, // { // characters: " world!", // start: 5, // end: 12, // fontName: { family: "Inter", style: "Regular" }, // boundVariables: {} // } // ]})()
```

##### Example: Extracting variables from fill styles

Sample code to convert existing styles into variables is available on our Git Hub.

##### Example: Import and export variables

Sample code to help import design tokens from other products or export variables into JSON format. This can further help with migration to variables or syncing design with development. Note that this sample only handles basic import/export and developers are encouraged to extend and customize this code to suit their specific needs.

### Working with Rich Text

**Note:** This guide covers rich text support for components and annotations. If you're looking for information about text, text nodes, and fonts in the Plugin API, try Working with Text.

When working with annotations or components, your plugin can read and write annotation labels and component descriptions with rich text using a subset of the standard Markdown format.

#### Markdown in the Plugin API

The Plugin API supports the following subset of Markdown formatting:

|Formatting|Markdown|
|---|---|
|Paragraph|`\n`|
|Numbered list|`1.`, `2.`, `3.`|
|Unordered list|`-`, `*`|
|Heading|`##`|
|Bold|`**` or `__`|
|Italic|`*` or `_`|
|Strikethrough|`~~`|
|Link|`link-string`|
|Monospace/inline code|``example code``|
|Code block|````example code````|

There are some small limitations when using Markdown with the Plugin API.

- Markdown formatting can't be used inside of code blocks.
- Only second-level headings are supported. If you use `#` to set a first-level heading, it's converted to heading level 2 in Dev Mode.
- In a code block, spaces at the start of a line are removed.

The following example shows an annotation in Dev Mode that uses rich text, and the corresponding Markdown.

!Example of a markdown-formatted annotation in Dev Mode

Markdown formats can vary widely, so we’ve also provided a helper function called `normalizeMarkdown`. We call this function implicitly before we set `labelMarkdown` or `descriptionMarkdown`, so it’s not required to call this on markdown you pass to either field. However, if you want a better understanding of exactly what markdown will be rendered, you can use this function. It is available within `figma.util`.

```
const component = getComponent();const md = buildMarkdown();const normalized = figma.util.normalizeMarkdown(md);component.descriptionMarkdown = normalized; // this is finecomponent.descriptionMarkdown = md; // this does the same thing
```

#### Annotations

Annotations store formatted text in the `labelMarkdown` field of the annotation.

To get the formatted text content of a node's annotation, read the value of `labelMarkdown`:

```
const node = figma.currentPage.selection[0];const markdown = node.annotations[0].labelMarkdown;
```

To add formatted text to a node's annotation, set `labelMarkdown` to a Markdown string:

```
if (figma.editorType === "dev") { const selectedNode = figma.currentPage.selection[0]; const markdown = `We should use **--err-red** for 500s.See the color examples for more info.Don't use:- deprecated \`--err-salmon\`- internal tokens`; selectedNode.annotations = [ { labelMarkdown: markdown, }, ];}
```

#### Component descriptions

Component Nodes store formatted text in the `descriptionMarkdown` field of the annotation.

To get the formatted text content of a component's description, read the value of `descriptionMarkdown`:

```
const components = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({ types: ["COMPONENT"],});components.forEach((component) => { console.log(component.descriptionMarkdown);});
```

To add formatted text to a component's description, set `descriptionMarkdown` to a Markdown string:

```
const components = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({ types: ["COMPONENT"],});components.forEach((component) => { component.descriptionMarkdown = "This is a **component**";});
```

### Working in FigJam

#### FigJam

FigJam is an online, collaborative whiteboard that teams use to brainstorm, develop, and organize ideas.

**Use cases for FigJam:**

- Brainstorm and explore ideas
- Create decision trees, diagrams, and mind maps
- Run critiques or feedback sessions on designs
- Collect ideas, note feedback, and organize research
- Plan and run meetings, tutorials, or other interactive sessions
- Collaborate and align with project stakeholders all in one place

And like Figma's other products, plugins can also integrate with FigJam.

!Cropped Figma file and cropped Fig Jam file next to each other

#### Key differences between plugins in FigJam and other plugins

Plugins in FigJam have some key differences when compared to other plugins:

##### Pages

FigJam files contain one or more pages, but the Plugin API in FigJam doesn't support the ability to create multiple pages. This includes the `create Page()` function.

##### Components

FigJam files have their own purpose-built stickers, which you can access using the plugin API, along with any components from your enabled libraries, or any designs pasted from Figma design files into FigJam files. You’ll also be able to access any local styles or instances in a FigJam file using the plugin API.

However, it’s not possible to create new components in a FigJam file using the plugin API, or combine existing components as variants. You won’t be able to use the following functions:

- `create Component()`
- `combine As Variants()`

You can, however, create an `InstanceNode` of a `ComponentNode` that is in a FigJam file.

##### Styles

When using the plugin API in FigJam files, you can only access styles applied to existing nodes. You won’t be able to create or manage local styles using the following functions:

- `create Paint Style()`
- `create Text Style()`
- `create Effect Style()`
- `create Grid Style()`
- `move Local Paint Style After()`
- `move Local Text Style After()`
- `move Local Effect Style After()`
- `move Local Grid Style After()`
- `move Local Paint Folder After()`
- `move Local Text Folder After()`
- `move Local Grid Folder After()`

##### FigJam-specific nodes

FigJam files have a few specific types of nodes, which are unique to that file type. This includes the `StickyNode`, `ShapeWithTextNode`, `ConnectorNode`, `CodeBlockNode`, `MediaNode`, and `TableNode` node types. When using the plugin API in FigJam, you can create and modify these node types.

It’s not possible to create these nodes in a Figma file, but you can read and modify any existing nodes of these types in Figma files.

If the `editorType` in your manifest does not include `figjam`, you **won’t** be able to access the following functions relating to those nodes:

- `figma.create Sticky()`
- `figma.create Shape With Text()`
- `figma.create Connector()`
- `figma.create Code Block()`
- `figma.create Gif()`
- `figma.create Table(num Rows, num Columns)`

##### FigJam Timer

FigJam files support a Timer, which allows users in a file to set a time limit for their activities and watch it count down. The timer is visible to everyone with at least view access to the FigJam file.

The timer is specific to FigJam files, so you can access it via the plugin API in FigJam.

If the `editorType` in your manifest does not include `figjam`, you **won’t** be able to access the **figma.timer** function. This includes any events and properties related to that function.

##### Modifying nodes

There are certain node types in FigJam that you only read and modify, and not create, those are the `BooleanOperationNode`, `StampNode`, and `WidgetNode` types.

##### Creating Figma-specific nodes in FigJam

There are some Figma-specific node types that can't be created using FigJam's UI, but can be created using the plugin API in FigJam. Those are the `LineNode`, `PolygonNode`, `RectangleNode`, `SliceNode`, `StarNode`, `TextNode`, and `VectorNode` types.

### Working in Dev Mode

#### Figma design's Dev Mode

Dev Mode is a mode in Figma design files that is dedicated to giving front-end developers everything they need to navigate design files and implement designs into code.

Key differences between Dev Mode and Figma's design mode are:

- The layers panel in Dev Mode is simplified and organized around Sections
- In Dev Mode, the Inspect panel has information that's helpful for design implementation, such as a CSS box model and a simplified view of properties, code, and assets
- Dev Mode is a read-only surface, since developers implementing designs often don't have write access to a Figma file

#### Plugins for Dev Mode

Like Figma's other products, plugins can also integrate with Dev Mode.

Plugins for Dev Mode help ensure developers have all of the relevant information that they need to implement a design in one place. Plugins for Dev Mode can be used for inspection and code generation.

**Inspection:** Plugins can take over the Inspect panel in Dev Mode and pull in relevant context from other tools that’s needed for design implementation, such as Jira, GitHub, or an internal API specific to your organization.

**Code generation:** Plugins can customize code generation using languages and frontend frameworks that Figma doesn’t support natively.

Plugins in Dev Mode have some key differences when compared to other plugins:

- **Pages are always dynamically loaded**: Unlike other plugins for the Figma editor, plugins for Dev Mode will _not_ load all pages in a file, even if `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"` isn't included in the plugin manifest. By default, a plugin in Dev Mode will only run on the user's current page. You can use the methods provided by the Plugin API to load additional pages as needed.
- **Read-only:** Plugins in Dev Mode are read-only, meaning they can use plugin APIs that read from the document, modify some metadata like plugin Data and relaunch Data, respond to API events emitted by Figma, make network requests, or open iframes to create UIs. However, these plugins **won't** be able to edit the contents of the document.
- **Plugin UIs:** If a plugin in Dev Mode opens an iframe, the iframe will take up the full height and width of the Inspect panel. This ensures the plugin’s iframe doesn’t obscure the canvas or what developers need to implement.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Dev Mode plugins can run in Figma for VS Code, in addition to running in Figma's web and desktop apps. Dev Mode plugins need to explicitly indicate that they are compatible with Figma for VS Code.

The Inspect panel is resizeable in Dev Mode. In Visual Studio Code, the Inspect panel is oriented horizontally, rather than vertically as in the Figma web and desktop apps. Because of these varied orientations, it's important to make sure that your plugin's iframe is responsive. Learn more →.

#### Plugins for inspection

Plugins in Dev Mode can be used for inspection, meaning they can show context associated with a selected layer in Dev Mode's Plugins panel.

##### How to get started

To start building a plugin for inspection, you must update your plugin manifest in the following ways:

- Set the `"editorType"` to `"dev"`
- Add `"inspect"` to the `"capabilities"` field
- Add `"vscode"` to the `"capabilities"` field if you want your plugin to work in Figma for VS Code

For example:

manifest.json for Dev Mode

```
{ "name": "Plugin for inspection", "id": "000000000000000000", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "code.js", "documentAccess": "dynamic-page", "editorType": ["dev"], "capabilities": ["inspect", "vscode"]}
```

See all of the options for the Plugin Manifest →

When structuring your code, you can utilize `figma.editorType` and `figma.mode` to determine what plugin behavior is allowed.

main.ts for Dev Mode

```
if (figma.editorType === "dev") { // Read the current page and listen to API events const numChildren = figma.currentPage.children.length figma.notify( `This is running in Dev Mode. The current page has ${numChildren}` );} else { figma.notify( `This is NOT running in Dev Mode. We can modify the file!` ); const node = figma.createRectangle(); node.name = "I proved that I can edit files!";}figma.closePlugin();
```

#### Plugins for code generation

Plugins in Dev Mode can also be used for custom code generation ("codegen"). These plugins can read the user's current selection and send Figma any generate code or related metadata associated with the layer. Importantly, any content generated by these plugins is rendered in the code section of the Inspect panel, in the same place you’d find Figma’s native code snippets. This means that you don't need to build or open an iframe in order to show users generated code.

You can use plugins to generate code for languages or framework that Figma doesn’t support natively, or to surface other metadata that a user might want, such as where to import icons in a codebase or internationalization string extraction.

Learn more about how to build Plugins for Codegen →.

#### Key differences between plugins in Dev Mode and other plugins

##### Limited access to the document

Plugin in Dev Mode can access the current page, load additional pages as needed, listen to events, and make network requests, but crucially they cannot modify the document, with the exception of writing certain metadata like plugin Data and relaunch Data. So, any method or operation in the plugin API that creates new nodes, deletes existing nodes, or modifies an existing node isn't available in Dev Mode.

For example, here are a few operations that would not work in Dev Mode:

Plugin trying to write to the document in Dev Mode

```
// This will throw an error because we are trying to create a new node.const node = figma.createRectangle();// This will throw an error because we are trying to remove an existing node.node.remove();// This will throw an error because we are trying to update a property on a node.node.name = "Button";
```

The following operations are valid to perform while in Dev Mode:

Plugin valid operations in Dev Mode

```
// Get a nodeconst node = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync('1:12');// Read a propertyconsole.log(node.name)// showUIfigma.showUI(__html__)// listen to eventsfigma.on('selectionchange', () => { // Do something})
```

In general, setter methods in the Plugin API do not work in Dev Mode. The only exceptions to this rule are for plugin Data, relaunch Data, and `export Async()`, which plugins can use regardless of the file permissions of the user who is running the plugin.

##### Reading from the document

When reading the document, the plugin will have access to the current page and ComponentNodes that the page references.

Plugin reading from the document in Dev Mode

```
// ✅ Works the same as in Figma design// Children of the current pagefigma.currentPage.children// findAll and findAllWithCriteriafigma.currentPage.findAll(node => node.name === 'Button')// Getting the main componentinstance.mainComponent// Changing the pagefigma.currentPage = figma.root.children[2]// Accessing data directly on the document rootfigma.root.getPluginData("plugin-data-id")
```

To load additional pages for your plugin to act on, follow the instructions in Accessing the Document.

##### skipInvisibleInstanceChildren

The skip Invisible Instance Children property is set to `true` in Dev Mode by default. This helps ensure plugins are more performant.

##### Responsive iframes

Because plugins in Dev Mode will take up the full width and height of the Inspect panel in Dev Mode, and because this panel is resizable by users, we recommend that you design your plugin iframes using the following guidelines:

1. Make sure the content inside of your plugin iframe can handle being responsively resized
2. Design your content around being vertically tall and handling scrolling overflow
3. The content of your iframe should be optimized around having a minimum width of 300px

#### Dev Mode plugins in Visual Studio Code

Dev Mode plugins require some minor updates to work in Visual Studio Code:

- `"vscode"` must be added to the `"capabilities"` field
- Plugins that open links must use `figma.openExternal` to do so
- Plugins that show UI that contains text fields should handle keyboard shortcuts
- Plugins that show dialogs in the UI like `alert()` or `confirm()` should implement custom UI for this functionality. VS Code blocks extensions from showing native dialogs like alert and confirm.

##### Opening links in Visual Studio Code

VS Code limits how extensions, like Figma for VS Code, can open links.

If your plugin needs to open links, like to sign in to a backend service, it must use the `figma.openExternal` method rather than `window.open` or `<a href="...">`-style links.

Opening links in VS Code: plugin iframe

```
// ui.html<script> function handleClick(event) { event.preventDefault(); var url = event.currentTarget.getAttribute("href"); parent.postMessage( { pluginMessage: { type: "OPEN_IN_BROWSER", url: url } }, "*" ); }</script><a href="https://google.com" onclick="handleClick(event)">Click Me</a>
```

Opening links in VS Code: plugin code

```
figma.ui.onmessage = (message) => { if (message.type === 'OPEN_IN_BROWSER') { figma.openExternal(message.url) }}
```

##### Handling keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio Code

Text-related keyboard shortcuts work differently in plugin UIs in VS Code.

Specifically, plugin UIs that are hosted elsewhere (i.e. you are navigating the plugin iframe to a custom URL, rather than HTML included with your plugin) do not support text-related keyboard shortcuts by default. This means that, unless you implement custom handlers as described in this section, users cannot use the following shortcuts within your plugin:

- Cut/copy/paste: `Cmd` (Mac) or `Ctrl` (Windows) + `X`/`C`/`V`
- Undo/redo: `Cmd-Z`, `Cmd-Shift-Z` (Mac), `Ctrl-Z`, `Ctrl-Y` (Windows)
- Select all: `Cmd` (Mac) or `Ctrl` (Windows) + `A`

If you have text inputs in your plugin UI, or text that users expect to copy, you should test these keyboard shortcuts to ensure they work as expected in VS Code. If they do not, we recommend adding custom keyboard event handling code.

In your plugin sandbox code:

1. Wait for your plugin UI to load.
2. Send a message to your plugin UI to tell it if your plugin is running in VS Code.

Keyboard shortcuts in VS Code: plugin code

```
figma.showUI(`<script>window.location = 'https://...'</script>`);figma.ui.onmessage = (msg) => { // Message sent from plugin UI when it's ready to receive messages // We don't want to send a message if the UI hasn't loaded yet if (msg === 'ready') { figma.ui.postMessage({ type: 'isVsCode', isVsCode: !!figma.vscode, // Tell our plugin UI whether we're running in VS Code }) }}
```

Then, in your UI code, you must listen for the keyboard shortcuts you want to handle, and execute the corresponding commands:

Keyboard shortcuts in VS Code: plugin iframe

```
window.onmessage = (e) => { if (e.data.pluginMessage) { const message = e.data.pluginMessage // If we get a message from the plugin sandbox saying that we're running // in VS Code, then we need to handle keyboard shortcuts ourselves if (message.type === 'isVsCode' && message.isVsCode) { console.log('in VSCode, adding keydown listener') document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => { const ctrlDown = e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey if (ctrlDown) { if (e.key === 'a') { document.execCommand('selectAll') } else if (e.key === 'z') { if (e.shiftKey) { document.execCommand('redo') } else { document.execCommand('undo') } } else if (e.key === 'x') { document.execCommand('cut') } else if (e.key === 'c') { document.execCommand('copy') } else if (e.key === 'v') { document.execCommand('paste') } } }) } }}// Tell our plugin code that we're ready to receive messagesparent.postMessage( { pluginMessage: 'ready', pluginId: 'USE-ID-FROM-MANIFEST-HERE' }, 'https://www.figma.com')
```

##### Determine if plugin is running in VS Code

Figma has reserved the `figma.vscode` namespace. Currently, we do not provide any VS Code-specific APIs, but we may add some in the future.

`figma.vscode` will be `undefined` if you are outside of the VS Code extension, so you can use this value to determine if your plugin is running inside of VS Code.

Determine if running in VS Code

```
if (figma.vscode) { // Do something in VS Code}
```
### Working in Slides

#### Figma Slides

Figma Slides is the first presentation tool built for designers and their teammates. No matter your role or level of design experience, Figma Slides makes it easy to create beautiful and effective slide decks. Use Figma Slides to build decks for:

- **Design reviews:** Share ideas and gather feedback using interactive polls and alignment scales
- **Startup pitches:** Use clickable prototypes to build excitement with potential investors
- **Class projects:** Create slide decks together using collaborative tools like audio and cursor chat
- **Conference talks:** Stay on-message with built-in presenter notes and more!

#### Getting started with Plugins in Figma Slides

To create a new plugin for Figma Slides, follow the Plugin Quickstart Guide to create a plugin, then come back to this guide.

To update an existing plugin to support Figma Slides, follow the steps below.

##### Update an existing plugin to support Slides

To enable plugins for Slides, add `slides` to the `editorType` field in your plugin's manifest:

```
{ ... "editorType": ["slides"] // or ["figma", "slides", ...]}
```

And, run `npm update` in the terminal to make sure you have the latest plugin typings for Slides:

```
npm update
```

#### Key differences between plugins in Slides and other plugins

Plugins in Slides have some key differences when compared to other plugins:

##### New Node Types

Figma Slides introduces four node types: SLIDE, SLIDE_ROW, SLIDE_GRID, and INTERACTIVE_SLIDE_ELEMENT.

###### SLIDE

`SLIDE`s are the primary building blocks of Figma Slides, with a fixed size of 1920x1080.

```
interface SlideNode extends BaseNodeMixin, SceneNodeMixin, ChildrenMixin, ContainerMixin, GeometryMixin, CornerMixin, RectangleCornerMixin, BlendMixin, ConstraintMixin, LayoutMixin, ExportMixin, FramePrototypingMixin, ReactionMixin { readonly type: 'SLIDE' clone(): SlideNode}
```

To create a slide, use `createSlide()`:

```
const mySlide = figma.createSlide()
```

###### SLIDE_ROW

`SLIDE_ROW`s are containers for slides and must be children of the `SLIDE_GRID`.

```
interface SlideRowNode extends BaseNodeMixin, SceneNodeMixin, ChildrenMixin { readonly type: 'SLIDE_ROW' children: Array<SlideNode> appendChild(child: SlideNode): void insertChild(index: number, child: SlideNode): void}
```

To create a Slide Row, use `createSlideRow()`:

```
const mySlideRow = figma.createSlideRow()
```

###### SLIDE_GRID

`SLIDE_GRID` is the top-level container for slides. It cannot be selected or edited in the UI but can be manipulated through its children (instances of `SLIDE_ROW`) via the Plugin API.

```
interface SlideGridNode extends BaseNodeMixin, SceneNodeMixin, ChildrenMixin { readonly type: 'SLIDE_GRID' children: Array<SlideRowNode> appendChild(child: SlideRowNode): void insertChild(index: number, child: SlideRowNode): void}
```

###### INTERACTIVE_SLIDE_ELEMENT

These elements include interactive types like `POLL`, `EMBED`, `FACEPILE`, `ALIGNMENT`, and `YOUTUBE`. They cannot be created via the Plugin API. However, their positions can be read and manipulated.

```
interface SlideNode extends BaseNodeMixin, SceneNodeMixin { readonly type: 'INTERACTIVE_SLIDE_ELEMENT' readonly interactiveSlideElementType: 'POLL' | 'EMBED' | 'FACEPILE' | 'ALIGNMENT' | 'YOUTUBE'}
```

##### Additional Features

###### Grid View and Single Slide View

Figma Slides allows toggling between grid view and single slide view. Access or set the mode using `viewport.slidesMode`:

```
const mode: 'grid' | 'single-slide' = figma.viewport.slidesModefigma.viewport.slidesMode = 'grid' // or 'single-slide'
```

###### Focused Slide ID

When in single slide view, access the focused slide using `currentPage.focusedSlide`:

```
const focusedSlide: SlideNode | null = figma.currentPage.focusedSlidefigma.currentPage.focusedSlide = slideNode
```

###### Reading and Updating the Slide Grid

The slide grid is a 2D representation of slides within a deck. Access the grid using `getSlideGrid()`:

```
const grid = figma.getSlideGrid()
```

To reorder slides, use `setSlideGrid()`:

```
figma.setSlideGrid([...rest, firstRow])
```

##### Slide Transitions

Define slide transitions with a specific style, duration, and curve:

```
{ style: 'NONE' | 'DISSOLVE' | 'SLIDE_FROM_LEFT', // etc. duration: number, // 0.01 - 10 seconds curve: 'EASE_IN' | 'EASE_OUT' | 'LINEAR', // etc. timing: { type: 'ON_CLICK' | 'AFTER_DELAY', delay?: number // 0-30 seconds },}
```

Read or update transitions using `getSlideTransition()` and `setSlideTransition()`:

```
slideNode.getSlideTransition()slideNode.setSlideTransition(slideTransition: SlideTransition)
```

The following transition `style`s are supported:

```
'NONE' | 'DISSOLVE' | 'SLIDE_FROM_LEFT' | 'SLIDE_FROM_RIGHT' | 'SLIDE_FROM_TOP' | 'SLIDE_FROM_BOTTOM' | 'PUSH_FROM_LEFT' | 'PUSH_FROM_RIGHT' | 'PUSH_FROM_TOP' | 'PUSH_FROM_BOTTOM' | 'MOVE_FROM_LEFT' | 'MOVE_FROM_RIGHT' | 'MOVE_FROM_TOP' | 'MOVE_FROM_BOTTOM' | 'SLIDE_OUT_TO_LEFT' | 'SLIDE_OUT_TO_RIGHT' | 'SLIDE_OUT_TO_TOP' | 'SLIDE_OUT_TO_BOTTOM' | 'MOVE_OUT_TO_LEFT' | 'MOVE_OUT_TO_RIGHT' | 'MOVE_OUT_TO_TOP' | 'MOVE_OUT_TO_BOTTOM' | 'SMART_ANIMATE'
```

The following transition `curve`s are supported:

```
'LINEAR' | 'EASE_IN' | 'EASE_OUT' | 'EASE_IN_AND_OUT' | 'EASE_IN_BACK' | 'EASE_OUT_BACK' | 'EASE_IN_AND_OUT_BACK'
```

##### Unsupported and Supported Features

###### Unsupported in Slides

Slides does not support:

- Components
- Styles
- Variables
- Libraries

Methods unavailable in Slides:

- `createConnector()`
- `createCodeBlock()`
- `createSection()`
- `createLinkPreviewAsync()`
- `setFileThumbnailNodeAsync()`

###### Supported in Slides but not in Design

Slides supports:

- `createShapeWithText()`
- `createTable()`
- `createGif()`

##### Additional Notes

When updating existing plugins for Figma Slides:

- Adjust conditions checking for `node.type === 'FRAME'` to also check for `node.type === 'SLIDE'`.
- Use `figma.getSlideGrid().flat().forEach(...)` for slide operations.
### Working in Buzz

#### Buzz

Figma Buzz enables brand designers to create and share on-brand assets, so teammates can grab what they need, when they need it. Buzz's simple design editor lets marketers or other teams create the assets they need quickly. Use Figma Buzz to make assets such as social media posts, digital ads, event materials, and more.

- **Publish templates:** Build assets using the creation tools in Figma Buzz or copy and paste designs from Figma Design, make necessary tweaks in Design mode, and publish in Figma Buzz for your peers to easily access and use.
- **Focused editing:** Teams can edit select sections within published templates, ensuring they are always staying on brand.
- **Freeform editing:** Remove template guidelines from a team template, start from scratch, or use a Figma-created template to edit freely and create exactly what you need. Riff and refine with design tools in a simplified editor.
- **Creation at scale:** Quickly create and edit thousands of assets at once. See them all in one view, regardless of size.

#### Getting started with Plugins in Figma Buzz

To create a new plugin for Figma Buzz, follow the Plugin Quickstart Guide to create a plugin, then come back to this guide.

To update an existing plugin to support Figma Buzz, follow the steps below.

##### Update an existing plugin to support Buzz

To enable plugins for Buzz, add `buzz` to the `editorType` field in your plugin's manifest:

```
{ ... "editorType": ["buzz"] // or ["figma", "buzz", ...]}
```

Then, run `npm update` in the terminal to make sure you have the latest plugin typings for Buzz:

```
npm update
```

#### Key differences between plugins in Buzz and other plugins

Plugins in Buzz have some key differences when compared to other plugins:

##### Plugin entry point

To ensure better discoverability for plugins, all Buzz plugins will show up in the left side panel by default and take up the entire height. Users will also be able to pop the plugin out into a modal. Because this left panel is resizable, we strongly recommend that you design your plugin iframes using the following guidelines:

- **Make sure the content inside of your plugin iframe can handle responsive resizing**
- **Design your content vertically and to handle scrolling overflow**

##### Views

Buzz supports two modes—grid view and asset view.

- **Grid view** lets you interact with all assets in a structured 2D layout
- **Asset view** allows focus on one asset in isolation

**Tip:** While you can add nodes anywhere on the canvas, you typically want to add the node to the grid so that users can see the node in asset view. To do this, you should:

- Use `figma.buzz.createFrame()` as opposed to `figma.currentPage.appendChild()`.
- Use `figma.moveNodesToCoord()` to insert a node into the grid (i.e. you've duplicated a frame with `.clone` and want to insert into the canvas grid).

##### Asset Types

Buzz introduces predefined asset types for common marketing formats like Instagram Stories or LinkedIn Ads. See the `Buzz Asset Type` documentation for a complete enumeration of the types.

##### Canvas Grid Management

Buzz uses a canvas grid system to organize media assets. You can programmatically manage this grid using:

- **`figma.getCanvasGrid()`** - Get the current canvas grid as a 2D array
- **`figma.setCanvasGrid(grid)`** - Reorganize the canvas grid layout
- **`figma.createCanvasRow(index?)`** - Create a new row in the canvas grid
- **`figma.moveNodesToCoord(nodes, row?, column?)`** - Move nodes to specific grid positions

##### Canvas View Management

Access or set the current view mode using `figma.viewport.canvasView`:

```
// Get current viewconst currentView = figma.viewport.canvasView // 'grid' | 'single-asset'// Set the view modefigma.viewport.canvasView = 'single-asset'
```

##### Focused Node Access

When in asset view, access the currently focused node:

```
// Get the focused nodeconst focusedNode = figma.currentPage.focusedNode// Set the focused nodefigma.currentPage.focusedNode = someNode
```

##### Working with Buzz-Specific APIs

The `figma.buzz` API provides specialized methods for media content:

```
// Create frames optimized for the canvas gridconst frame = figma.buzz.createFrame(0, 0) // row 0, column 0// Manage asset typesfigma.buzz.setBuzzAssetTypeForNode(frame, 'INSTAGRAM_STORY')const assetType = figma.buzz.getBuzzAssetTypeForNode(frame)// Extract and update contentconst textFields = figma.buzz.getTextContent(frame)const mediaFields = figma.buzz.getMediaContent(frame)// Smart resizing for different platformsfigma.buzz.smartResize(frame, 1080, 1080)
```

##### Event Handling

Listen for canvas view changes to adapt your plugin's behavior:

```
figma.on('canvasviewchange', (event) => { if (event.view === 'SINGLE_ASSET') { // User focused on single asset console.log('Asset view') } else { // User viewing grid console.log('Grid view') }})
```

##### Best Practices

- Any nodes that are added to the canvas should be added specifically to the grid. For example, if you clone a node, make sure you move it to the canvas:

```
// Move cloned node to gridconst cloned = node.clone();if (figma.editorType === 'buzz') { figma.moveNodesToCoord([cloned.id], row, col); // NEW}// If creating a frame, you can use the createFrame() functionconst frame = figma.buzz.createFrame(row, col);
```

- When inserting images into a Buzz asset, avoid directly setting image fills on the top-level frame. Instead, create a rectangle node with the image fill and insert it as a child of the top-level frame. This approach ensures that the image appears as a separate object within the frame rather than replacing the frame's background fill, which is consistent with how images are inserted from the Media side panel in the Buzz Editor.

```
// Get the selected Buzz asset (top-level frame)const buzzAsset = figma.currentPage.selection[0];// Create a rectangle to hold the imageconst rectangleNode = figma.createRectangle();// Load and apply the image fillconst image = figma.createImage(imageBytes); // your image data as Uint8ArrayrectangleNode.fills = [{ type: 'IMAGE', imageHash: image.hash, scaleMode: 'FILL'}];// Size the rectangle appropriatelyrectangleNode.resize(400, 300);// Insert the rectangle as a child of the Buzz assetbuzzAsset.appendChild(rectangleNode);// Alternatively, you can use the Buzz Media Content API// if working with template-based assets that have predefined media fields// and you'd like to replace the image fill of one of those media fieldsconst mediaContent = figma.buzz.getMediaContent(buzzAsset);if (mediaContent.length > 0) { await mediaContent[0].setMediaAsync(image.hash, 'IMAGE');}
```

##### Unsupported and Supported Features

###### Unsupported in Buzz

Buzz does not support these node types:

- `CANVAS`
- `STICKY`
- `CONNECTOR`
- `CODE_BLOCK`
- `TABLE`
- `MEDIA`
- `WEBPAGE`
- `SLIDE`
- `INTERACTIVE_SLIDE_ELEMENT`

Methods unavailable in Buzz:

- `createPage()`
- `createConnector()`
- `createCodeBlock()`
- `createTable()`
- `createSticky()`
- `createSlide()`
- `createSlideRow()`
- `createPageDivider()`
- `createLinkPreviewAsync()`
- `setFileThumbnailNodeAsync()`

##### Additional Notes

When updating existing plugins for Figma Buzz:

- Use `figma.buzz.createFrame()` instead of `figma.createFrame()` for grid-aware positioning
- Check for `figma.editorType === 'buzz'` to enable Buzz-specific functionality
- Consider responsive design for the resizable left panel interface
- Use asset types to ensure proper platform formatting

### OAuth with Plugins

In this section, we'll look at how to build a Figma plugin that uses a 3rd-party service which the user needs to authenticate to. For example, you might want to write a plugin that uses Google authentication to read data from one of the user’s private Google spreadsheets.

#### Prerequisites

- This guide assumes you already have knowledge of OAuth. If not, this guide might help. We also encourage you to be familiar with the OAuth Threat Model and Security Considerations.

- You must have a server with a publicly available HTTPS Internet address.

- You must be able to register your plugin with the OAuth provider you plan to use. This will involve configuring a redirect URL that points to your server.


#### Comparison to other environments

OAuth with Figma plugins is different from OAuth in other environments that you’re probably used to, such as on a website or in a native app:

- Usually, when you are implementing OAuth for a website, you open the authentication page with `window.open()`, the user authenticates, and then the authentication page you opened sends you the access token using `window.opener.postMessage()`.

However, this doesn't work for Figma plugins. The Figma desktop app is an Electron app, not a browser. Calling `window.open()` from a plugin in the Figma desktop app opens a new window in the browser where `window.opener` is `null`.

- Usually, when you were implementing OAuth for a native app, you open the authentication page in the browser, the user authenticates, and then the authentication page you opened sends the access token to your native app.

However, this doesn't work for Figma plugins. This is usually done either by the app registering a custom URI scheme with the system, or by the app temporarily running a local server on the network loopback interface. The OAuth provider can then navigate to that URI (either a custom scheme or a local server) with the access token as a parameter to pass it to the app. Neither of these are things you can do from within a Figma plugin for security reasons.


The only way to do OAuth in a Figma plugin is to run your own server on the public Internet and have the user authenticate your server via OAuth. You can then send the access token from your server back down to the Figma plugin.

This unfortunately requires more effort to implement in a secure way than doing everything locally. The sensitive access token can potentially be intercepted on its way to or from the server. When implementing OAuth, please be very mindful of this risk and try to ensure that access tokens do not remain on the server any longer than absolutely necessary.

If you know about Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) and your OAuth provider supports it, we strongly recommend that you use it for improved security. This ensures that even if the read key, the write key, or the authorization code from the OAuth provider is intercepted by an attacker, they can’t use that information to redeem the authorization code for an access token.

#### Authentication flow

These following steps describes how you can invoke the OAuth provider from within a Figma plugin and get back a piece of information. What that information means depends on the provider.

In particular, we strongly recommend using Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) if your OAuth provider supports it. In that case the information sent to the plugin will be an authorization code, not an access token. The authorization code will need to be redeemed by the plugin for an access token.

Remember to test this flow both within a browser and within the Figma desktop app! Figma plugins can be used in both environments and users will expect both of them to work.

1. The plugin checks whether it’s already authenticated, by checking its local storage through `figma.clientStorage` - see below.

2. The plugin opens an iframe using the `figma.showUI(...)` API call. The iframe is necessary for accessing browser APIs for making network requests.


3. This plugin iframe redirects to a hostname under your control, for example a page hosted on your internet server. This will place the iframe on a non-null origin, which enables us to securely check its identity later in the flow.

4. If the user is already authenticated, communicate the existing token to the iframe so it can use it to speak to the relevant APIs, using `figma.ui.post Message`. Make sure to pass an `origin` in the `options` field matching your iframe’s origin.

5. If the user isn’t already authenticated, from an API call made by your plugin iframe, your server generates a unique read/write key pair.



The read key allows you to read the value written by the write key. It will be used by the plugin to poll for the result of the OAuth flow. Each key is only usable once, which is why there are two different ones.

The write key allows you to write a value once to the server that can then be read by the read key. It will be used by the server to get the result back to the plugin after the user authenticates.

6. The plugin iframe opens a new window hosted on your internet server using `window.open(url, '_blank')` and passes it the write key.

⚠️ Your OAuth provider should support the OAuth `state` parameter. You _**must**_ use that to pass along the write key. You _**must**_ also store the write key in cookies on your internet server’s origin. Note that we cannot write cookies in the UI frame, because many browsers will treat such cookies as “third-party” and block them. These must be set during the top-level navigation. We also recommend adding an interstitial at this step for users to confirm that they intend to link their accounts.


7. The user authenticates with the OAuth provider. This may involve the user logging into the service if they haven’t already logged in.

8. The OAuth provider redirects back to your server. This redirects to the URL that you have pre-registered with your OAuth provider when you set up the integration, and should pass the `state` parameter back along.

⚠️ At this point, your server _**must**_ verify that the write key stored in the `state`parameter fed back to the server matches the value it stored in the user’s cookie. If it doesn’t match, your server should fail the request.

9. Your server uses the write key to write the information you’ve received from the OAuth provider back to your server. This will not automatically re-focus the Figma desktop app. You should indicate to the user that authentication is complete and that they should switch back to the Figma desktop app.

⚠️ This write _**must**_ be done over HTTPS, not HTTP. The access token is very sensitive data, because it grants access to the authorized resource.

10. The plugin iframe polls your server using the read key.

⚠️ This _**must**_ be done over HTTPS, not HTTP. The access token is very sensitive data because it grants access to the authorized resource. ⚠️ You _**must**_ ensure that only this origin, which must be a real hostname under your control, can access this polling endpoint’s response, for instance by hosting them on the same origin or by correctly configuring CORS, or other plugins may be able to perform this flow masquerading as yours.

When the value has been written, the read will succeed.

#### Saving the access token locally

You likely won’t want the user to have to authenticate every time they run your plugin. To fix this, access tokens can be saved client-side using the client storage API once they have been obtained. First, communicate your token from your plugin iframe back to your main plugin code. See the documentation for how to send this message.

⚠️ Since your UI frame will be running on a non-null origin, you _**must**_ pass a `pluginId` matching your plugin when communicating the token to it from this frame. You _**must**_ also restrict the audience of this postMessage to `https://www.figma.com`, so an attacker masquerading as Figma cannot get access to your authorization token from this message.

Then, from within the main plugin code:

```
await figma.clientStorage.setAsync('my-token', token)
```

This value is stored in local storage inside the browser and is not stored on Figma’s servers. Client storage is specific to the current user ID and plugin ID. Other plugins run by the same user and other users running the same plugin will not be able to read this value. The value can be retrieved by the main plugin code later on, from the same data store:

```
const token = await figma.clientStorage.getAsync('my-token')
```

Note that this must be done from your main plugin entry point (`"main"` in `manifest.json`) even though the entire OAuth flow must be driven by your UI entry point (`"ui"` in `manifest.json`). You will have to use message passing to allow both of these entry points to communicate. See Creating a User Interface for more details.

### Debugging

First open the Developer Tools panel by clicking the "Plugins > Development > Open Console..." or use the shortcut ⌥⌘I. It should look like this:

Note that you may need to switch to the "Console" tab if another tab is currently active.

This panel lets you debug your plugin in various ways:

##### Use it to explore the API

You can try out the plugin API here. Try typing `figma.currentPage` and pressing Enter. This will execute that expression and show the return value, just as if your plugin had executed the same expression.

You should see a something like `PageNode {id: "0:1"}` in the console. This is the object returned from executing `figma.currentPage`. Try clicking the little triangle to the left of it to see the properties available on the object.

![](https://static.figma.com/uploads/a77c254095b2f6f4f878b2f35ecdc898843c5ff0)

Note that the `(...)` text next to each property is clickable. When clicked the console will show the value of that property and will let you explore further into the object and its properties.

If the current page contains any layers it can be especially interesting to click the `(...)` next to `children` to see a list of all the layers directly in the page and explore their properties.

##### Print out what your plugin is doing

If you want to inspect the value of a variable in your plugin, the easiest way to do that is to call `console.log(value)` from your plugin code. That will show up in this console.

Note: once your plugin has finished executing, the little `(...)` next to properties will stop working on any objects that were printed to the console while by the plugin. The easiest way to work around that is to remove the `figma.closePlugin()` call from your plugin while you are debugging.

#### Developer VM

Plugins that are currently being developed (those in the "Plugins > Development" menu) can be run in the Developer VM by checking the "Plugins > Development > Use Developer VM" option. When the option is enabled, these plugins will run in the browser's JavaScript engine, so that developer tools can be used.

Note: running a plugin in the Developer VM will have different performance characteristics than running in the normal sandbox. It is best to do performance testing and final verification without this option as the Developer VM can give unrealistic results.

To find a plugin's source code in the dev tools, add a `debugger;` statement somewhere in the file to add a breakpoint. When the plugin execution reaches that line, the source code will show in the dev tools centered on that line.

### Frozen Plugins

##### I accidentally caused an infinite loop. What do I do?

You will be unable to click the “Cancel” button because the editor tab will be hung waiting for your plugin to end. You have to close and reopen the hanging editor tab and restart your plugin.

If you have the developer tools open, can push the ‘pause’ button (in the ‘Sources’ tab) to see why your script is in an infinite loop.

##### My plugin needs to do a long-running task. What do I do?

Sometimes, your plugin might be frozen not because it has a bug, but because it's genuinely doing an operation that takes a long time. This could be for example, a plugin that applies some complex filter on an image, or a plugin that touches every node in a document. Users create really large Figma documents!

It's not the best experience for the user if the UI is completely frozen while the plugin finishes. But it's one of the tradeoffs we had to make to let your plugin run on the JavaScript main thread. In exchange for a more simple API, we can't prevent plugins from freezing the UI. Here are different ways you can potentially deal with this:

- **Split your work into chunks**

The best way to keep the UI responsive is to split your work into chunks. The idea is to only do a little bit of computation (e.g. a fixed number of nodes, or for a few milliseconds), then yield to the main thread before continuing. This allows the browser to process any events, such as a mouse click on the cancel button. A typical way to do this is to use `setTimeout(() => { ... rest of your computation ... }, 1)` which schedules more computation to be run on a subsequent frame, possibly in conjunction with `Promise`s and `async/await`.

- **Use CSS animations**

An imperfect but inexpensive way to make the plugin _look_ like it's not frozen is to have a progress spinner, implemented using **only** CSS animation (no JavaScript). Even when the rest of the UI is frozen, the CSS animation can still play on some browsers. The reason is that many browsers implement animation composition outside the main thread. However, note that this is only an aesthetic improvement.

- **Use a WebWorker**

Web Workers are a browser feature that allows you to create a JavaScript background thread to perform expensive computation. This can be useful for expensive task such as image decoding or processing. However, note that WebWorkers are like iframes in that they can only communicate with their creator via message-passing. They won't have access to the `figma` global or any nodes. As such, WebWorkers are best suited to run functions that have a single input and output, and don't need to access the document repeatedly.

- **Contact us**

If you're surprised by something taking a long time (e.g. you're only changing the opacity of a hundred nodes), contact us! We can help you diagnose the issue, it could be one of our APIs that is unnecessarily slow. As always, sample code + a sample file will greatly speed up the process.
### Text Review Plugins

A text review plugin is a plugin that either replaces or supplements the native spellcheck functionality inside of Figma or FigJam. Here are a few example use cases of text review plugins:

- Checking for spelling mistakes using a REST API
- Checking for spelling mistakes in languages that Figma doesn't support
- Checking for grammar mistakes
- Checking for style guide violations
- Checking for branding violations

When in text edit mode, a plugin will be notified of changes to text and can mark ranges of text that are incorrect. The plugin can also offer suggestions that should be returned when someone right clicks on a misspelled region.

Plugins that have text review capabilities have a unique feature that other plugins don't: they are started automatically anytime a user starts editing text in the document.

Considerations about how pages are loaded in the document still apply to text review plugins. However, as text review plugins act on the user's current page, it's unlikely you'll need to worry about loading additional pages.

Note: When in text edit mode, a plugin can only read from the document, it can't edit it.

#### Getting started

A plugin that can run in text review mode must have `"textreview"` listed in its list of capabilities. This lets Figma know that a user can enable the plugin as a text review plugin.

```
{ "name": "MyPlugin", "id": "{your id here}", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "code.js", "ui": "ui.html", "capabilities": ["textreview"]}
```

#### A quick example

Below is a fully featured text review plugin implementation that highlights any occurrences of the word "yeet" in a string and suggests that it be replaced with the word "throw":

Yeet checking example

```
if (figma.command === 'textreview') { // If the plugin is in text review mode (i.e. the plugin was started // automatically because the user started typing in a text node) // set up a text review event that listens to a user's typing // and looks for occurrences of "yeet". figma.on('textreview', ({ text }) => { if (!text) { return [] } const yeetRegex = /yeet/gi const yeetMatches = Array.from(text.matchAll(yeetRegex)) return yeetMatches.map((match: any) => { return { start: match.index, end: match.index + match[0].length, suggestions: ['throw'], color: 'GREEN', } }) })} else if (!figma.textreview?.isEnabled) { // Otherwise, if the user started the plugin manually, // request to be enabled as a text review plugin. figma.textreview ?.requestToBeEnabledAsync() .then(() => { console.log('I am now the default!') }) .catch(() => { console.log('User declined to enable this plugin.') }) .finally(() => { figma.closePlugin() })} else { // Otherwise the plugin is enabled so close immediately figma.closePlugin()}
```

#### Reviewing text

To tell that you are in `textreview` mode the `figma.command` property will be set to `textreview`.

The text review events are fired periodically while a user is editing text in Figma. Note that Figma will automatically debounce calls to this function and invalidate stale results returned from it. These are registered by calling `figma.on('textreview')`. The callback you provide to this function will take a `TextReviewEvent` as a parameter and return either a `TextReviewRange[]` or `Promise<TextReviewRange[]>`.

```
type TextReviewEvent = { text: string}type TextReviewRange = { start: number end: number suggestions: string[] color?: 'RED' | 'GREEN' | 'BLUE'}
```

Your plugin can mark ranges of the text, denoted by the `start` and `end` properties on the returned value, which will show a squiggle under the word to denote that there is an error. The color of the squiggle is determined by the `color` property which can be either one of `'RED'`, `'GREEN'`, or `'BLUE'`. If there are multiple overlapping ranges, either from your plugin or from Figma's built in spell check we will always show red squiggles first, then green ones, and finally blue ones.

You can also return an array of `suggestions` that will be shown as possible substitutions if a user right clicks on the marked word.

In the example below we take the text property from the text review event and highlight the entire range of text with a green squiggle which will suggest with 'Figma' and 'FigJam' if a user right clicks on the range:

Always green example

```
figma.on('textreview', ({ text }: TextReviewEvent): TextReviewRange[] => { return [ { start: 0, end: text.length, suggestions: ['Figma', 'FigJam'], color: 'GREEN', }, ]})
```

The callback to a `'textreview'` event can also return a `Promise` which is useful in cases where you want to call an external API to check text for grammatical errors. Note that a convenient way to use this is to pass `figma.on('textreview')` an async function:

Async example

```
figma.on('textreview', async ({ text }: TextReviewEvent): Promise<TextReviewRange[]> => { const result = await fetchSomeSuggestionsFromTheInternet(text) return processResults(result)})
```

#### Letting a user enable your plugin for text review

The first interaction that a user will likely have with your plugin is from running it from the resources modal in Figma / FigJam. Often users will look to your plugin to enable and disable text review capabilities. We offer the `figma.textreview` suite of APIs for this purpose:

figma.textreview interface

```
interface TextReviewAPI { requestToBeEnabledAsync(): Promise<void> requestToBeDisabledAsync(): Promise<void> readonly isEnabled: boolean}
```

`Text Review API` is an interface that allows users to request to be enabled or disabled. To request to be enabled, call the requestToBeEnabledAsync() method. To request to be disabled, call the requestToBeDisabledAsync() method. The isEnabled property can be used to check if your plugin is enabled as a text review plugin for the user.

##### `figma.textreview.requestToBeEnabledAsync()`

This method will request your plugin to be enabled as a text review plugin for the user. A modal will pop up that will ask the user if they want to enable the plugin for text review:

The promise returned by the function will be resolved if the user presses accept in the dialog and will be rejected if the user cancels. Note that to prevent spam the promise will be auto rejected if the user cancels the request multiple times in a given plugin run.

##### `figma.textreview.requestToBeDisabledAsync()`

This method will disable the plugin as a text review plugin if it is enabled. The promise will resolve if it has been successfully been disabled and reject if it wasn’t enabled in the first place.

##### `figma.textreview.isEnabled`

This property is a readonly boolean that can be used to check if your plugin is enabled as a text review plugin for the user. It will be true if the plugin is enabled and false if the plugin is disabled.

### Plugins for Code Generation

Plugins in Dev Mode can extend Figma's native code snippets to generate code for languages or frameworks that Figma doesn’t support, or to surface metadata that a front-end developer might find useful when implementing a design in code (e.g. where to import icons in a codebase or internationalization string extraction).

Plugins in Dev Mode specifically built for code generation ("codegen") appear in the Figma's native language dropdown. Once selected from this menu, the `figma.codegen.on("generate")` callback will get called any time the user's selection changes.

Considerations about how pages are loaded in the document still apply to plugins that generate code. However, as plugins for codegen act on the user's current page, it's unlikely you'll need to worry about loading additional pages.

Check out the Working in Dev Mode guide for a general overview of Dev Mode and how to build plugins for Dev Mode

#### Getting started

If you're building a plugin for code generation, your manifest should specify:

- `"dev"` as an editor type
- `"codegen", "vscode"` as capabilities
- At least one supported language via the `"codegenLanguages"` field. You may list multiple languages if your plugin supports more than one code language.

Basic manifest.json for plugins for code generation

```
{ "name": "MyCodegenPlugin", "id": "{your id here}", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "code.js", "editorType": ["dev"], "capabilities": ["codegen", "vscode"], "codegenLanguages": [ {"label": "React", "value": "react"}, ]}
```

You can also specify custom preferences for your plugin via the `"codegen Preferences"`field. These preferences allow users of your plugin to customize the codegen output and can be read by the plugin via the figma.codegen.preferences API.

There are 3 types of codegen preferences:

|itemType|description|
|---|---|
|`"unit"`|This is useful if your plugin supports a scaled unit.|
|`"select"`|This is useful if your plugin supports customizations from a fixed set of options.|
|`"action"`|This is useful if you need more customization options and want to open an iframe.|

###### Scaled unit codegen preferences

By default, all codegen languages should support a pixel unit. However, in a lot of cases, it makes more sense to write code using a scaled unit. If applicable, plugins can use this preference option to define properties of a scaled unit and whether to default to it. For every code language your plugin supports, this option should be defined at most once in your manifest, and it will be accessible to users from a settings menu in the Code section of the Inspect panel in Dev Mode.

The callback for `figma.codegen.on("generate")` is automatically called whenever unit preferences are changed. Inside the callback, you can access `figma.codegen.preferences`to condition the generated code accordingly.

As an example, this test plugin supports a `Rem` scaled unit.

###### Select codegen preferences

These are useful for providing multiple choice options to users to allow them to customize the generated code. For example, a plugin might choose to support custom formatting options.

The callback for `figma.codegen.on("generate")` is automatically called whenever any selected preferences are updated. Inside the callback, you can access `figma.codegen.preferences` to modify the generated code accordingly.

###### Action codegen preferences

Action codegen preferences are useful if you need more than a custom scaled unit or multiple choice preference options for your plugin. "Action" preferences allow you to open an iframe (via figma.showUI) to support even more user preferences. When selected, the `figma.codegen.on("preferenceschange")` callback will get called.

Any preferences inside the iframe will need to be stored and managed by your plugin using something like `figma.client Storage`. Additionally, when these custom preferences change, you need to manually call `figma.codegen.refresh` to make sure the displayed code is updated.

#### A simple example

Here is a simple codegen plugin that returns the selected node's name in the Code section of the Inspect panel in Dev Mode:

Basic Codegen Plugin

```
// Make sure that we're in Dev Mode and running codegenif (figma.editorType === "dev" && figma.mode === "codegen") { // Register a callback to the "generate" event figma.codegen.on("generate", ({ node }) => { return [ { title: "Section Title", language: "PLAINTEXT", code: "Generated code for " + node.name + " goes here" } ] })}
```

The "generate" callback will be fired whenever the selection changes and whenever codegen preferences are updated. The callback you provide to this function will take a `Codegen Event`as a parameter and return either a [`CodegenResult[]`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenResult/) or a `Promise<CodegenResult[]>`.

The callback registered by `figma.codegen.on("generate")` has a timeout of 3 seconds and returns an error if it times out. For more information, see the figma.codegen.on API

#### Examples

##### Plugin manifest with multiple languages

Example manifest.json including all codegenPreference itemTypes and multiple languages

```
{ "name": "MyPlugin", "id": "{your id here}", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "code.js", "editorType": ["dev"], "capabilities": ["codegen"], "codegenLanguages": [ {"label": "React", "value": "react"}, {"label": "Typescript", "value": "typescript"} ], "codegenPreferences": [ { "itemType": "unit", "scaledUnit": "Rem", "defaultScaleFactor": 16, "default": true, "includedLanguages": ["react"] }, { "itemType": "select", "propertyName": "tabSize", "label": "Tab Size", "options": [ {"label": "2", "value": "2", "isDefault": true }, {"label": "4", "value": "4"}, {"label": "8", "value": "8"} ], "includedLanguages": ["typescript"] }, { "itemType": "action", "propertyName": "showMore", "label": "More settings...", "includedLanguages": ["typescript"] } ]}
```

##### Multiple code sections

When building a plugin for code generation, it's possible to organize your generated code into different sections, so that they are easier to read and copy by front-end developers. In the example below, we return an HTML section and a CSS section where the HTML section uses the classnames declared by the CSS section.

Simple example

```
figma.codegen.on("generate", () => { return [ { language: "HTML", code: `<div class="container"> <div class="box"></div> </div>`, title: "HTML", }, { language: "CSS", code: `.container { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100vh; } .box { width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: #000; } `, title: "CSS", }, ];});
```

##### Using `figma.showUI` for code generation

`figma.showUI` is not allowed within the generate callback. Instead, if `figma.show UI` is required in the generate callback, the `showUI` call should be moved outside of the callback and `figma.ui.post Message` should be used within the callback instead. This ensures that the plugin is able to handle concurrent "generate" events.

Using figma.showUI for code generation

```
let nextMessageIndex = 1;const resolveByMessageIndex: Record< string, (response: CodegenResult[]) => void> = {};figma.showUI( `<script> window.onmessage = async (event) => { const { messageIdx, cssStr } = event.data.pluginMessage // Do code generation here: parent?.postMessage( { pluginMessage: { type: "RESULT", result: "Result for " + cssStr, messageIdx, }, }, "*" ); }</script>`, { visible: false },);figma.ui.on("message", (msg) => { if (msg.type === "RESULT") { resolveByMessageIndex[msg.messageIdx]?.([ { language: "PLAINTEXT", code: msg.result, title: "Result from iframe", }, ]); delete resolveByMessageIndex[msg.messageIdx]; }});figma.codegen.on("generate", async ({ node }) => { const messageIdx = nextMessageIndex++; return new Promise(async (resolve) => { const cssProps = await node.getCSSAsync(); const cssStr = Object.entries(cssProps) .map(([k, v]) => `${k}: ${v};`) .join("\n"); resolveByMessageIndex[messageIdx] = resolve; figma.ui.postMessage({ messageIdx, cssStr, }); });});
```

##### Using properties on the CodegenEvent

Often front-end developers will need to pull out strings for an internationalization dictionary when doing application development. Below is a codegen plugin that gets all of the Text Nodes in a user's current selection and builds a JSON dictionary of them.

Generating a JSON string dictionary

```
figma.codegen.on("generate", (eventData): CodegenResult => { const node: SceneNode = eventData.node; // Initialize the array to hold all text strings let textStrings: string[] = []; // Check if the node has a 'findAll' function if ("findAll" in node) { // Find all text nodes, and return their content textStrings = node .findAll((childNode) => childNode.type === "TEXT") .map((textNode: SceneNode) => { const text: TextNode = textNode as TextNode; return text.characters; }); } // Initialize the JSON object to hold the text strings let jsonStringsDictionary: { [key: string]: { string: string; }; } = {}; // Convert each string into a JSON entry for (const textString of textStrings) { // Convert the string to a suitable format for a JSON key const jsonKey = createJsonKey(textString); // Add the string to the JSON object jsonStringsDictionary[jsonKey] = { string: textString }; } // Return the codegen result return [ { language: "JSON", code: JSON.stringify(jsonStringsDictionary, null, 2), title: "i18n Dictionary", }, ];});// Function to create a JSON key from a stringfunction createJsonKey(inputString: string) { return inputString.toLowerCase().replace(/\s/g, "_");}
```

### Requiring Payment

#### Introduction

The Payments API allows you to to create custom time or usage-based free trials for plugins and widgets. Here are some examples of free trial experiences you can create:

- A remove background plugin that lets you remove the background from five images before having to pay
- A stock illustration plugin that gives you free access to a library of PNG illustrations, but requires payment to access vector illustrations
- A vector editing plugin that lets you warp or bloat vectors for free, but requires payment for rendering text on a path and other more powerful vector manipulation features
- A copy-editing plugin includes a 30 day free trial

You can use this API to:

- Read metadata about a user’s payment status and usage of your resource
- Kick off a checkout flow so a user can pay for your resource

If you customize the free trial experience for a plugin or widget, you must include information in the resource’s description that clearly explains what’s included in the trial and how long the trial lasts (if time-based).

#### Getting Started

In order to use the Payments API, you must first add `"payments"` to the `"permissions"`field in your `manifest.json`:

```
{ "name": "My plugin", "id": "{your id here}", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "code.js", "ui": "ui.html", "permissions": ["payments"] ...}
```

If your `manifest.json` doesn’t contain this field, Payments API methods will throw errors when called.

#### An Example

Below is a simple paid plugin implementation that checks whether the user has paid for the plugin or is currently in a time-based free trial. If not, it kicks off the checkout flow. Otherwise, the plugin displays a message to the user.

```
async function run() { if (figma.payments.status.type === "PAID") { figma.notify("USER HAS PAID"); } else { // figma.payments.status.type === "UNPAID" const ONE_DAY_IN_SECONDS = 60 * 60 * 24; const secondsSinceFirstRun = figma.payments.getUserFirstRanSecondsAgo(); const daysSinceFirstRun = secondsSinceFirstRun / ONE_DAY_IN_SECONDS; if (daysSinceFirstRun > 3) { await figma.payments.initiateCheckoutAsync({ interstitial: "TRIAL_ENDED", }); if (figma.payments.status.type === "UNPAID") { figma.notify("USER CANCELLED CHECKOUT"); } else { figma.notify("USER JUST PAID"); } } else { figma.notify("USER IS IN THREE DAY TRIAL PERIOD"); } } figma.closePlugin();}run();
```

You can find more examples of using the Payments API here.

#### When to call `initiateCheckoutAsync`

The main way to kick off the checkout flow is to call `figma.payments.initiate Checkout Async`. When called, the user will be prompted to enter their payment information and purchase your resource.

There are certain cases where calling `figma.payments.initiate Checkout Async` will throw an exception and this table describes how to avoid them:

|Case|Workaround|
|---|---|
|Query mode with Plugin Parameters|Put calls to this function inside your "run" event handler.|
|Query mode with Text Review Plugins|Use `figma.payments.request Checkout` instead.|
|During widget rendering|Put calls to this function inside your widget event handlers.|

### Migrating Plugins to Dynamically Load Pages

In 2023, Figma started to dynamically load pages for Figma designs. Previously, when a Figma file was accessed, all pages in the document were loaded, which led to delays in loading very large or complex files. Now, pages in Figma design files are loaded only as needed. Because pages are loaded only as needed, it is no longer guaranteed that all information in a document is accessible via the Plugin API without additional requests for page data.

This transition required the deprecation of incompatible methods and addition of new dynamic loading compatible methods in the Plugin API. This guide describes how to upgrade your plugin to use these new methods.

#### How to upgrade your plugin

To upgrade your plugin:

1. Update the type definitions.
2. Install the linter.
3. Update your plugin's manifest.
4. Update the plugin code to use the async APIs.

#### Update the type definitions

To support the way Figma loads pages as needed, we’ve updated the Plugin API. TypeScript type definitions for the changes are available in our official typings.

To access these type definitions, ensure your plugin’s package.json file contains the following entry:

package.json

```
{ ... "devDependencies": { ... "@figma/plugin-typings": "*" }}
```

Then, re-run `npm install`.

#### Install the linter

Figma provides a set of typescript-eslint rules that help identify, and in many cases automatically fix, areas of your plugin code that need to be migrated.

To install and use the linter, follow the instructions in the **Usage** section of the README included with the linter rules. Find the `eslint-plugin-figma-plugins` repository on Git Hub →

**Note:** The linter works for TypeScript files only. If your code is written in JavaScript, you can use a regex snippet to search for code that might need to be changed to be compatible with dynamic page loading. While this isn't all-encompassing, it should make the migration process easier. This regex snippet can be used in an editor like VS Code to search through your plugin code:

```
((figma\.getNodeById)|(figma\.getStyleById)|(figma\.getFileThumbnailNode)|(figma\.getLocalTextStyles)|(figma\.getLocalPaintStyles)|(figma\.getLocalEffectStyles)|(figma\.getLocalGridStyles)|(figma\.variables\.getVariableById)|(figma\.variables\.getVariableCollectionById)|(figma\.variables\.getLocalVariableCollections)|(figma\.variables\.getLocalVariables)|(\.instances)|(\.consumers)|(\.mainComponent)|(\.effectStyleId =)|(\.fillStyleId =)|(\.gridStyleId =)|(\.textStyleId =)|(\.backgroundStyleId =)|(\.strokeStyleId =)|(\.setRangeTextStyleId)|(\.setRangeFillStyleId)|(\.setRangeTextStyleId)|(\.setRangeFillStyleId)|(\.setBoundVariable)|(figma\.variables\.setBoundVariableForPaint)|(createVariable))
```

#### Update your plugin’s manifest

Dynamic page loading introduces a new field to the existing manifest fields: `documentAccess`.

Adding `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"` to your plugin’s manifest tells Figma that it does not need to preemptively load all pages in a file before running your plugin. The manifest field and value are included by default in Figma’s plugin templates, so you won’t need to worry about this step when you create new plugins. The `documentAccess` field is a required manifest field for plugins and must be set to `dynamic-page`.

manifest.json

```
manifest: { ... "documentAccess": "dynamic-page"}
```

When `documentAccess` is not included in the manifest, the first time a legacy plugin runs in a newly-opened file, Figma ensures all nodes, pages, and contents of the file are loaded before running the plugin. If a Figma file is very large, this load can take around 20 to 30 seconds. Only contents of the file that have not been loaded on the client will need to be loaded, so any subsequent plugin runs during the same session will be able to run immediately, as before.

#### Overview of changes

With dynamic page loading, several methods are no longer supported and are replaced by new async versions that will retrieve these objects if they have not been loaded on the client. If you call any of the deprecated APIs when in dynamic page loading mode, your plugin will throw.

Variables and Styles specifically are considered objects that exist outside of pages. Similar to regular nodes, before setting a variable or a style, we need to make sure that it has been loaded on the client. We achieved this by updating APIs where a StyleId, a VariableId, or a VariableCollectionId is used directly to instead use a Style, Variable, or a VariableCollection object.

##### Net-new methods

- figma.load All Pages Async()
- figma.variables.create Variable Alias By Id Async()
- Page Node.load Async()

##### Deprecations and replacements

Several methods and properties have been deprecated in favor of `async` replacements:

- Use `figma.get File Thumbnail Node Async()` instead of `figma.get File Thumbnail Node()`.
- Use `figma.get Local Effect Styles Async()` instead of `figma.get Local Effect Styles()`.
- Use `figma.get Local Grid Styles Async()` instead of `figma.get Local Grid Styles()`.
- Use `figma.get Local Paint Styles Async()` instead of `figma.get Local Paint Styles()`.
- Use `figma.get Local Text Styles Async()` instead of `figma.get Local Text Styles()`.
- Use `figma.get Node By Id Async()` instead of `figma.get Node By Id()`.
- Use `figma.get Style By Id Async()` instead of `figma.get Style By Id()`.
- Use `figma.variables.get Local Variable Collections Async()` instead of `figma.variables.get Local Variable Collections()`.
- Use `figma.variables.get Local Variables Async()` instead of `figma.variables.get Local Variables()`.
- Use `figma.variables.get Variable By Id Async()` instead of `figma.variables.get Variable By Id()`.
- Use `figma.variables.get Variable Collection By Id Async()` instead of `figma.variables.get Variable Collection By Id()`.
- Use `set Range Fill Style Id Async()` instead of `set Range Fill Style Id()`.
- Use `set Range Text Style Id Async()` instead of `set Range Text Style Id()`.

In some specific cases, reading node properties has been deprecated in favor of an `async`getter:

- Use `Component Node.get Instances Async()` instead of `Component Node.instances`.
- Use `get Style Consumers Async()` instead of the `consumers`.
- Use `Instance Node.get Main Component Async()` instead of `Instance Node.main Component`.

In some specific cases, assigning values directly to node properties has been deprecated in favor of an `async` setter:

- Use `figma.set Current Page Async()` instead of assigning to `figma.current Page`.
- Use `set Effect Style Id Async()` instead of assigning to `effect Style Id`.
- Use `set Fill Style Id Async()` instead of assigning to `background Style Id`.
- Use `set Fill Style Id Async()` instead of assigning to `fill Style Id`.
- Use `set Grid Style Id Async()` instead of assigning to `grid Style Id`.
- Use `set Reactions Async()` instead of assigning to `reactions`.
- Use `set Stroke Style Id Async()` instead of assigning to `stroke Style Id`.
- Use `set Vector Network Async()` instead of assigning to `vector Network`.
- Use `Text Node.set Text Style Id Async()` instead of assigning to `Text Node.text Style Id`.

If an extension's manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, accessing any of the deprecated items listed above will throw an exception.

##### Method/property usage changes

If an extension's manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, calling any of the following methods will throw an exception unless you first call figma.load All Pages Async():

- `Document Node.find All()`
- `Document Node.find All With Criteria()`
- `Document Node.find One()`
- `Document Node.find Widget Nodes By Widget Id()`

For the methods listed below, passing a string ID is now deprecated in favor of passing objects that the IDs refer to. If an extension's manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, passing an ID will throw an exception.

- `figma.variables.create Variable()` - Pass a `Variable Collection` object instead of a collection ID.
- `clear Explicit Variable Mode For Collection()` (present on multiple node types) - Pass a `Variable Collection` object instead of a collection ID.
- `set Explicit Variable Mode For Collection()` (present on multiple node types) - Pass a `Variable Collection` object instead of a collection ID.
- `set Bound Variable()` (present on multiple node types) - Pass a `Variable` object instead of a variable ID.

If an extension's manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, some properties and methods of `Page Node` will throw an exception unless you explicitly load the page first using `Page Node.load Async()`. These include:

- `Page Node.append Child()`
- `Page Node.children`
- `Page Node.export Async`
- `Page Node.find All()`
- `Page Node.find All With Criteria()`
- `Page Node.find Child()`
- `Page Node.find Children()`
- `Page Node.find One()`
- `Page Node.find Widget Nodes By Widget Id()`
- `Page Node.insert Child()`

##### Changes to events

- If an extension's' manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, the `documentchange` event will not be available unless you first call `figma.load All Pages Async()`.
- Where possible, prefer using the `nodechange` and `stylechange` events, which do not require triggering a full-document load.

#### Update plugin code to use async APIs

To update your plugin code to use the async APIs, you'll generally refactor your functions to use `async` and `await`.

**Examples of upgrading to async:**

Example: figma.getNodeById() → figma.getNodeByIdAsync()

```
// Beforefunction extractTextContent(nodeId: string): string[] { const node = figma.getNodeById(nodeId) const textNodes = node.findChild(child => child.type === "TEXT") return textNodes.map(textNode => textNode.characters)}// Afterasync function extractTextContent(nodeId: string): Promise<string[]> { const node = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync(nodeId) const textNodes = node.findChild(child => child.type === "TEXT") return textNodes.map(textNode => textNode.characters)}
```

Example: InstanceNode.mainComponent → InstanceNode.getMainComponentAsync()

```
// Beforefunction getDefinitionNode(node) { if (node.type !== "INSTANCE") { return node } const { mainComponent } = node return mainComponent?.parent?.type === "COMPONENT_SET" ? mainComponent?.parent : mainComponent}// Afterasync function getDefinitionNode(node) { if (node.type !== "INSTANCE") { return node } const mainComponent = await node.getMainComponentAsync() return mainComponent?.parent?.type === "COMPONENT_SET" ? mainComponent?.parent : mainComponent}
```

Example: getStyleById() & set node.fillStyleId → getStyleByIdAsync() & node.setFillStyle()

```
// Beforefunction swapFillStyles(node1, node2) { const fill1 = node1.fillStyleId const fill2 = node2.fillStyleId node1.fillStyleId = fill2 node2.fillStyleId = fill1}// Afterasync function swapFillStyles(node1, node2) { const fill1Id = node1.fillStyleId const fill2Id = node2.fillStyleId await node1.setFillStyleAsync(fill2Id) await node2.setFillStyleAsync(fill1Id)}
```

##### Change DocumentNode.find* methods

These methods currently work by searching nodes in the document. Some of them search all nodes in the entire document, others only search the children of the current node. These two types will have different requirements moving forward.

With `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, `DocumentNode.find*` methods that search all nodes in entire document will throw unless `figma.loadAllPagesAsync()` has been called explicitly in the plugin.

Plugins must call `figma.loadAllPagesAsync()` before calling any of the following `DocumentNode.find*` methods.

- `figma.root.findAll()`
- `figma.root.findOne()`
- `figma.root.findAllWithCriteria()`

With `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, `DocumentNode.find*` methods that only search the children of the node (not all nodes in the document) remain the same. These methods are the following:

- `figma.root.findChild()`
- `figma.root.findChildren()`

Example: findAll

```
/** * Find all nodes named "Color" */// Beforeconst colors = figma.root.findAll(n => n.name === "Color")// Afterawait figma.loadAllPagesAsync()const colors = figma.root.findAll(n => n.name === "Color")
```

Example: Document traversal

```
// This plugin counts the number of layers, ignoring instance sublayers,// in the document.// Beforefunction getNumNonInstanceChildren(node) { let count = 0; const toVisit = [node] while (toVisit.length) { const curr = toVisit.pop() if (curr.type !== "INSTANCE") { toVisit.push(...curr.children) } count++; } return count;}// Afterasync function getNumNonInstanceChildren(node) { let count = 0; const toVisit = [node] while (toVisit.length) { const curr = toVisit.pop() if (curr.type === "PAGE") { await curr.loadAsync() } if (curr.type !== "INSTANCE") { toVisit.push(...curr.children) } count++; } return count;}
```

##### Explicitly access other pages in the document

`DocumentNode.children` will continue to return all of the PageNodes in the file. However, before traversing into PageNode.children, plugins will have to explicitly call `PageNode.loadAsync()` or load the page using one of the other asynchronous methods provided. `PageNode.children` will throw an exception if called on a page that has not been explicitly loaded by the plugin. The `loadAsync()` method only exists on PageNodes as Figma loads entire pages in together.

Example: Logging the number of children on all pages

```
// Beforefor (const page of figma.root.children) { console.log(`Page ${page.name} has ${page.children.length} children`)}// Afterfor (const page of figma.root.children) { await page.loadAsync() console.log(`Page ${page.name} has ${page.children.length} children`)}
```

Example: Counting the number of nodes in a document

```
// This plugin counts the number of empty pages in a file// Beforefunction countEmptyPages() { let emptyPageCount = 0 const pages = DocumentNode.children for (const page of pages) { if (page.children.length === 0) { emptyPageCount++ } } return emptyPageCount}// Afterasync function countEmptyPages() { let emptyPageCount = 0 const pages = DocumentNode.children for (const page of pages) { await page.loadAsync() if (page.children.length === 0) { emptyPageCount++ } } return emptyPageCount}
```

##### Accessing the current page

`figma.currentPage` remains the same and continues to return the current page without any async operations. If you are accessing the current page using an expression like `figma.root.children[x]`, then you will be required to call `loadAsync()` as described earlier. To set the current page you must use the new async setter `figma.setCurrentPageAsync(PageNode)`. This ensures the page is loaded prior to setting it as the current page.

Accessing the Document →

##### Listening to document change events

When `documentAccess` is set to `"dynamic-page"`, the `on('documentchange')` event requires that you call `figma.loadAllPagesAsync()` before registering the callback to ensure that events from all pages are listened to.

If you wish to listen to events without loading all pages, we have added two new event APIs. To subscribe to the changes on a specific page, you can use the `PageNode.on('nodechange')` callback. You can add as many `nodechange` callbacks as you want.

NodeChangeEvent interface

```
interface NodeChangeEvent { nodeChanges: NodeChange[]}type NodeChange: CreateChange | DeleteChange | PropertyChangetype CreateChange: {type: 'CREATE', node: SceneNode | RemovedNode}type DeleteChange: {type: 'DELETE', node: SceneNode | RemovedNode}type PropertyChange: {type: 'PROPERTY_CHANGE', properties: NodeChangeProperties[], node: SceneNode | RemovedNode}pageNode.on('nodechange', (event: NodeChangeEvent) => {})
```

If you wish to subscribe to only style changes, you can use the new `figma.on('stylechange')` callback.

StyleChangeEvent interface

```
interface StyleChangeEvent { styleChanges: StyleChange[]}type StyleChange: CreateChange | DeleteChange | PropertyChangetype CreateChange: {type: 'STYLE_CREATE', style: PaintStyle | TextStyle | GridStyle | EffectStyle | null}type DeleteChange: {type: 'STYLE_DELETE', style: PaintStyle | TextStyle | GridStyle | EffectStyle | null}type PropertyChange: {type: 'STYLE_PROPERTY_CHANGE', properties: StyleChangeProperty[], style: PaintStyle | TextStyle | GridStyle | EffectStyle | null}figma.on('stylechange', (event: StyleChangeEvent) => {})
```

Example: Log observed changes

```
// This plugin logs all of the CREATE changes made to the document// Beforefigma.on("documentchange", (e) => { for (const change of event.documentchanges) { if (change.type === "CREATE") { console.log( `Node ${change.id} created by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user` ); } }})// After (a specific page)const page = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync('2:2')page.on("nodechange", (e) => { for (const change of event.nodechanges) { if (change.type === "CREATE") { console.log( `Node ${change.id} created by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user` ); } }})// After (all pages)await figma.loadAllPagesAsync()figma.on("documentchange", (e) => { for (const change of event.documentChanges) { if (change.type === "CREATE") { console.log( `Node ${change.id} created by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user` ); } }})// After (a style change)figma.on("stylechange", (e) => { for(const change of event.stylechanges) { if(change.type === "STYLE_CHANGE") { console.log( `Style ${change.id}` ); } }})
```

##### Accessing all pages

Because loading all pages can be slow in large files, we strongly recommend that you only load pages as needed. Very large files can also run into a memory limit when all pages are loaded.

If you need access to all pages of a document, you can use the new API:`figma.loadAllPagesAsync(): Promise<void>`

This method loads all pages in the document and is useful in the following two use cases:

- Traversing the entire document via `DocumentNode.find*` methods
- Listening for Document Changes

This method is subtly different from loading all pages manually via: `await Promise.all(figma.root.children.map(page => page.loadAsync()))`

With `figma.loadAllPagesAsync`, new pages added by other clients will automatically be loaded on the client as well.

### Libraries and Bundling

In the plugin manifest section, we covered how to set up a simple Figma project with all plugin code in a single file. For a basic plugin with limited functionality, having everything in one place makes sense. But all the code must be in one file, which doesn’t scale for very long. These days, most websites use hundreds of files and libraries in a single project.

Libraries are collections of prewritten code. They allow you to reuse common JavaScript functions or patterns in your own websites and applications.

Take a look at the following example:

```
<html> <head> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css"> <script src="libraries/scripts.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin></script> </head> <body> </body></html>
```

While `<script>` tags can be used to include multiple libraries, having hundreds of these tags would not be the most efficient way to include your project dependencies. A common solution is to bundle all code and dependencies into one file. Because everything is technically in one file, bundling can optimize your project by making less server requests.

#### Bundling with Webpack

Webpack is a widely used JavaScript library and module bundler that packages your project files for use in a browser. Loading scripts individually in a web app can be very costly and Webpack can improve a project’s load speed by bundling script files. Instead of making multiple requests, a bundle of script files only needs to be requested once. In this section, we’ll go over how you can bundle your projects with this tool. We are going to:

1. Install Webpack
2. Setup Typescript with Webpack
3. Create a bundle
4. Import modules

We recommend taking a look at the Plugin Quickstart Guide before using Webpack to install other dependencies required to build a Figma plugin.

##### Install Webpack

1. Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to **Terminal** > **New terminal** to open a command line window in VS Code.
3. In the terminal, run the following commands. These commands will save Webpack to your current project and install other dependencies into your project:

```
npm install
```

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

If the commands are successful, the `node_modules` folder is created in Visual Studio Code and Webpack is added to our list of devDependencies in `package.json`.

If you followed our Plugin Quickstart guide, you’ll already have a `node_modules`folder in your project.

##### Setup Typescript with Webpack

We recommend using Typescript for developing Figma plugins. In order for our plugin to compile properly, we need to configure Webpack to use Typescript.

1. Install the Typescript compiler and loader by running the following command. You can verify the installation by checking that `ts-loader` is now under the list of dependencies in `package.json`.

```
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
```

2. Now, we’ll change up the project structure by creating a directory named `dist`. Right-click in the file explorer and select **New Folder…**

3. Then, drag `code.js` and drop it into the new `dist` directory.
4. Create another directory named `src` then move `code.ts` into it. Our updated project structure should look something like this:

5. Since we changed the location of our `code.js`, we also need to update the `main` field in `manifest.json` to reflect the change:

```
// manifest.json{ "name": "bundling-test2", "id": "1174728261122583026", "api": "1.0.0", "main": "dist/code.js", "editorType": [ "figma", "figjam" ]}
```

6. Open `package.json` then update `build` to `"webpack"`. This will allow us to run a webpack build with a simple terminal command.

```
// package.json..."scripts": { "build": "webpack", "watch": "npm run build -- --watch"},...
```

7. Then, open `tsconfig.json` and replace it with the following. This sets our compiler options to include Typescript files from the `src` folder and assigns `dist` as the output directory.

```
// tsconfig.json{ "compilerOptions": { "target": "es6", "lib": ["es6"], "strict": true, "typeRoots": [ "./node_modules/@types", "./node_modules/@figma" ], "outDir": "./dist", "jsx": "react", "allowJs": true, "moduleResolution": "node" }, "include": ["src/**/*.ts"]}
```

8. Since the Figma desktop app works a little differently than the browser, we need to add some Webpack configurations. We are going to create a `webpack.config.js` file at the root of our project.

9. Copy the following code and add it to your `webpack.config.js` file:

```
const path = require('path');const webpack = require('webpack');module.exports = (env, argv) => ({mode: argv.mode === 'production' ? 'production' : 'development',// This is necessary because Figma's 'eval' works differently than normal evaldevtool: argv.mode === 'production' ? false : 'inline-source-map', entry: { code: './src/code.ts' // This is the entry point for our plugin code. }, module: { rules: [ // Converts TypeScript code to JavaScript { test: /\.tsx?$/, use: 'ts-loader', exclude: /node_modules/, }, ], }, // Webpack tries these extensions for you if you omit the extension like "import './file'" resolve: { extensions: ['.ts', '.js'], }, output: { filename: '[name].js', path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), },});
```

If you want to learn more about how `webpack.config.js` works, we recommend reading the Webpack documentation →

After all the changes, our project structure should look something like this:

10. Now, our Webpack modules should compile and our plugin should run properly. Save all your changes, then run a build of the project by running `npm run build` in the terminal. You’ll see a success message if the modules compiled with no errors.

11. Check that your plugin runs in the Figma desktop app by going to **Plugins** > **Development** then selecting your plugin.

If you are working with the starter code from the **Plugin Quickstart Guide**, you’ll see five orange rectangles in the canvas.


##### Create a bundle

Now that we have Webpack installed and integrated with Typescript, we can start splitting up our plugin code into multiple files. This can be done through the use of JavaScript **modules**. A **module** is a bundle of code that can **export** functionality to other modules and **import** functionality from other modules.

In this section, we’ll take a look at how we can import and export modules between files.

1. Cut the following lines of code from `code.ts` :

```
const rect = figma.createRectangle();rect.x = i * 150;rect.fills = [{type: 'SOLID', color: {r: 1, g: 0.5, b: 0}}];figma.currentPage.appendChild(rect);nodes.push(rect);
```

2. In `rectangle-module.ts` create an exported function named `createRectangles()`and paste in the code from `code.ts`:

```
export function createRectangles(i:number, nodes: SceneNode[]) { const rect = figma.createRectangle(); rect.x = i * 150; rect.fills = [{ type: "SOLID", color: { r: 1, g: 0.5, b: 0 } }]; figma.currentPage.appendChild(rect); nodes.push(rect);}
```

3. Then, go back to `code.ts`. At the top of the file, create an import statement for the `createRectangles` function:

```
import { createRectangles } from "./rectangle-module"
```

4. Finally, in `code.ts` call the `createRectangles` function under the `nodes` declaration:

```
const nodes: SceneNode[] = [];for (let i = 0; i < msg.count; i++) { createRectangles(i,nodes);}
```

5. Save your changes, then run a build of the project using `npm run build`.

6. Run your plugin again in the Figma desktop app. The plugin should work the same way, but with Webpack bundling our modules together behind the scenes. Rather than making requests to multiple TypeScript files, a single request is made to `code.ts`.


If you have issues running your plugin after creating modules, check that you have an `export` statement in your `createRectangles()` function and that your `import` statement in `code.ts` is correct.

##### Import all modules

You can further simplify your import statements by importing everything from a library:

```
import * as MyCode from "./rectangle-module";
```

`MyCode` is the alias for our library. This is what we’ll use to reference the file and the pre-written code from it. Update your `createRectangles` function call to reflect the new import:

```
MyCode.createRectangles(i, nodes);
```

The concept of importing and exporting modules is the basic idea behind bundling. You can see how in a larger project, importing modules from a library saves you time and prevents redundancies in your code.

Webpack only understands JavaScript and JSON, so HTML and CSS files are converted into modules in a format that a browser can consume.

To see what bundling with Webpack and React looks like for a Figma plugin, take a look at the Webpack sample directory in the plugin-samples repository. This may require additional Webpack configuration.

Learn more about these concepts on the Webpack JS website →

#### Using Plugma

Plugma is a community-created toolkit to create plugins with support for common frameworks and additional development tools. To get started run the following command and follow the prompts:

```
npm create plugma@latest
```

For more information on what Plugma offers you can visit their documentation.

Plugma is a third-party library and not officially maintained by the Figma team.

#### Using Create Figma Plugin

Create Figma Plugin is a community-created toolkit to create plugins with bundling, UI components, and helpful utilities configured out of the box. To get started, run the following command and follow the prompts:

```

#### Bundling with Esbuild

Esbuild is a JavaScript bundler built with Go that is even faster than Webpack. Much like Webpack, Esbuild converts your files into modules then creates a bundle for the browser to consume. Esbuild also supports Typescript and JSX out of the box, so you don’t need to worry about these extra configurations.

Learn more about bundling with Esbuild on their website →

There are a lot of bundling tools out there, so feel free to use the module bundler you feel is best for your project. Take a look at this esbuild-react example in our plugin-samplesrepository.

### Build Scripts

This workflow described above has a race condition: If you edit a source file and run the plugin quickly enough, the bundler may still be busy generating the output files and the current output files may be stale. This is especially likely if your bundler is slow. To get around this, you can use an optional `"build"` field in `manifest.json`. This specifies a script that Figma will run to completion before your plugin is run. If you use that to build your bundle, then Figma is guaranteed to always use the correct up-to-date output files.

This is a very advanced workflow and definitely not required. It also has a lot of rough edges and isn't necessarily ready for use yet. We're just mentioning it in case you find it helpful. An easy alternative to using a build script is to run your bundler in watch mode and just wait for your bundler to finish building before you run the plugin in Figma. We hope to improve this workflow in the future.

One big caveat is that Figma's desktop app currently doesn't set the `PATH` environment variable correctly. Your script may need to use absolute paths and/or contain code to import the right path from somewhere.

If you'd like to configure Webpack as a build script instead of manually running Webpack commands, you could try adding this line to your `manifest.json`. This assumes your `node`binary is located at `/usr/local/bin/node`. Note that this is a lot slower than running Webpack in watch mode because Webpack is not optimized for fast startup time.

manifest.json

```
{ ... "build": "/usr/local/bin/node node_modules/.bin/webpack --mode=production", ...}
```

### Resource Links

The main suggested solution for using external resources is using the embedding method described in the webpack section. Alternatively to this, you can link to external resources. However this comes with several constraints:

You have to use absolute URLs starting with `http://` or `https://` and host the resources on your own server. It is currently not possible to ship other resources with the plugin and link to them. To ship additional resources they have to be embedded.

It is only possible to link to external resources from within the `<iframe>` created using `figma.showUI()`. It is not possible to directly load javascript libraries or other resources directly from the main thread JavaScript code.

Using external resources likely means that the plugin will not work if the user is offline when they run the plugin. The Figma editor currently is able maintain limited functionality and run plugins even if the user loses connectivity after having opened the editor. However if the plugin tries to load external resources, accessing those will likely require connectivity.

In order to link to external resources from within the `<iframe>`, put normal HTML markup in your UI, such as `<img src="...">`, `<link href="..." rel="stylesheet">` or `<script src="..."></script>`. However you have to use absolute URLs starting with `http://` or `https://` and host the resources on a server reachable by the plugin user.

Additionally, since `eval()` works in the main thread JavaScript, it is possible to use `fetch()`or `XMLHttpRequest` to load a script from the network inside the `figma.showUI()``<iframe>`, send the script to the main thread using `postMessage`, and then `eval()` the string.

### Figma Components

It's good practice to make a plugin's UI consistent, to the degree that it is possible, with the rest of the Figma UI. This almost always leads to a better experience for users.

Figma does not maintain an official set of resuable components, but our Plugin Samples repository has links to community-developed frameworks, starter kits, and HTML/CSS samples.

### Publishing

When developing a plugin, it's reasonable (sometimes even advisable) to focus on the core use case of your plugin and make sure that it works when the user does what you expect. That's the "first 80% of the work".

However, there's often a "second 80% of the work" needed to make sure that your plugin does something reasonable in situations that you didn't expect. Here's a checklist of things worth thinking about. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, and we will add to it over time:

- Have you loaded all the data your plugin needs?
- Do you need to access pages other than the user's current page?
- If your plugin is only meant to do something if a certain type of nodes is selected, what happens when:
- The user has nothing selected?
- The wrong type of node selected?
- Multiple things selected?
- A component selected? Are you alright with the change propagating to potentially hundreds of instances?
- If your plugin modifies a text layer, what happens if the font for that text layer is missing?
- If your plugin can edit a component, what happens if the component comes from the team library?
- If your plugin needs to load resources over the network, what happens if the user is temporary offline when they run your plugin?
- If your plugin stays open for a while:
- What happens if the user deletes a node you currently have a reference to?
- What happens a multiplayer even causes changes in the document?
- If your plugin is concerned with the position of layers, what happens if something is rotated?
- If your plugin can traverse large parts of the document (e.g. search for a node), what happens if the document is very large?
- Can you load pages only as needed instead of loading the whole document?
- If you're using a bundler, have you checked the output size of your plugin? Could you make it smaller (e.g. by running your bundler in release mode)?

### Stability and Updates

This section is about:

- How new API updates are released.
- How the Figma team provides stability to **published** plugins.

One of our top priorities for the plugins API is stability. It's important for our users that plugins don't break all the time. This is especially true given that Figma is a fast-moving product with weekly new releases (generally on Wednesdays).

On the other hand, we also want to strike the right balance between providing new functionality quickly and maintaining backwards compatibility. Below is how we intend to do that.

#### API Versioning

Changes to the plugins API are identified as "Version X, Update Y". The first number "X" represents the major version number, and the second number "Y" represents minor updates.

##### Minor updates

New **additive** APIs and minor bug fixes will be provided as minor **updates**. These new APIs will become automatically available to plugins, as long as the plugin is using the latest version. This may mean you need to upgrade the plugin major version to get an update.

You will still need to get the latest typings file manually by downloading it or creating a new project and copying the typings file from there.

If an API has a bug, we may ship the bug fix as a minor update upon our discretion. It depends on whether we feel like there's a risk that some may plugins break as a result of _fixing_ the bug. While any change in the behavior of an API could theoretically make a plugin work or not work, it's extra overhead for both plugin authors and for us to consider every bug fix to be a breaking change.

**TypeScript**: We may change the _typings_ of the API in breaking ways during minor updates too. In the TypeScript world that, typings and code are two separate things. As such, changes to typings don't affect existing code and don't cause published plugins to break. Having typings that accurately represent the latest state of the API is more important than having perfect backwards compatibility since types are easy to update. Generally, typings change only involve renaming some types.

##### Major versions

Changes to existing APIs will be provided as major **versions**. These are changes that are likely to have a visible effect on plugins and require plugin authors to update their code.

This includes both changes to the API itself (e.g. removing a deprecated function) or changes to the behavior of the API (e.g. suppose we decided that all `create<NodeType>` functions no longer parent to the canvas by default).

Plugins will not be automatically upgraded to these changes. The `api` field in the manifest specifies the major version. To keep existing plugins working, the Figma team commits to support old major versions as long as practically possible.

#### Changes to the Figma product affecting plugins

There are situations where we might add a new feature, and a plugin might do the wrong thing or "break" just by virtue of not supporting the feature. For example, suppose that we added a new type of export setting called `"MP4"` and a plugin has code like:

```
switch (setting.format) { case "JPG": { ... break } case "PNG": { ... break } case "SVG": { ... break } case "PDF": { ... break } default: { throw "I don't know what this export type is, so I give up and error" }}
```

There's not necessarily a whole lot we can do to keep the plugin working in that case. These types of changes don't happen too often or affect all plugins, but when it does, we will do our best to give a heads up to plugin developers accordingly,

### Proposed API

#### What are proposed APIs?

Proposed APIs are APIs that are only available during development. This allows plugin authors to try out new APIs and provide the Figma team feedback about whether the API satisfies their needs, and/or behaves in any unexpected ways. The list of APIs in "proposed" stage is listed on this page below. Having APIs in a proposed stage allows us to change the API based on feedback without breaking published plugins.

APIs will remain in "proposed" stage for 2-4 weeks, depending on the feedback received. Giving us feedback can accelerate the process, as we're looking to see that developers have tested them out! See the updates to check if it's been released.

#### How do I use proposed APIs?

In the manifest, add `"enableProposedApi": true`. This flag is only meant for development, and will not work in published plugins! You may want to create a separate branch that uses these news APIs if you intend to release regular plugin updates during that time, or hide uses of the API behind if statements.

If you use TypeScript, get the latest typings with these APIs.

#### Current proposed APIs

None at this time.

## Overview 

### API Reference

The API reference includes the resources and materials to navigate the Plugin API. You can explore the Plugin API using any of the entry points in the sidebar.

If you’re new to Figma or plugins, we’ve outlined some of the key resources involved below. Make sure to read through our development guides for tips and best practices!

#### Global objects and variables

You can access most of the Plugin API through the `figma` global object and its sub-objects. You’ll find properties and functions that allow you to view, create, and update the contents of files.

There are also global variables available across the Plugin API: `__html__` and `__ui Files__`. You can use these variable to access the contents of your ui files.

**Explore global objects and variables →**

#### Node types

In Figma, nodes are the way we represent the contents of a file. Every layer in a Figma design or FigJam file corresponds to a node.

Each node supports a range of properties. Some properties are universal, some are shared between nodes and some are unique to specific node types.

Select a **Node type** to see which properties are supported on that node.

#### Node properties

Some node properties are supported across node types. You can use the Shared Node Properties section to explore these shared properties. We show which node types a property is supported on.

#### Data types

To assist you with writing your plugin code, we provide a TypeScript typings file for the entire Plugin API. The typings file is a collection of type and interface declarations you can use for type checking.

These declarations represent groups of related properties, parameters, and other data you’ll interact with in Figma. You’ll see types and interfaces in a few places in the API reference.

- To get and set properties on nodes or global objects
- Passed as parameters in a function
- Returned by a method

You can access types and interfaces from any properties and methods that use them. Or, you can explore types and interfaces in the Data Types section of the sidebar.

#### Other resources

##### Plugin manifest

Every plugin must define a `manifest.json` file that describes the plugin. Figma creates a simple manifest when you register a plugin for development.

You can extend this manifest to take advantage of optional functionality. For example: accept plugin parameters, or create private plugins in an organization.

**View plugin manifest properties →**

##### Typings file

The API reference and documentation explain the structure of the the API and how it works. This is great when exploring the API or understanding supported features and functions.

We provide a typings file with type annotations for the entire Plugin API. When used with an editor, like VSCode, this provides you with suggestions as you code. This helps to reduce errors and catch edge cases.

We also provide a set of typescript-eslint rules that ensure you're correctly using the Plugin API. The GitHub repository includes detailed instructions for installing and using the rules to test your plugin code.

You don’t have to use TypeScript when developing plugins, but we strongly recommend you do! The API reference and all associated guides use it.

**Set up Type Script →**

💡 We update the typings file any time we make changes to the API. To get the latest typings, run `npm install --save-dev @figma/plugin-typings`.

### Plugin Manifest

Each plugin must define a `manifest.json` file that describes the plugin. If you use the "Create new plugin" dialog, Figma will automatically create a simple manifest for you. You can extend this generated manifest to take advantage of additional features, for example, to declare a submenu for your plugin.

Example:

```
{ "name": "MyPlugin", "id": "737805260747778092", "api": "1.0.0", "editorType": ["figma", "figjam"], "main": "code.js", "ui": "ui.html", "documentAccess": "dynamic-page", "networkAccess": { "allowedDomains": ["none"] }}
```

##### name: string

The name of the plugin, as it will appear in the menu.

---

##### id: string

The plugin ID to publish updates to. This ID will be assigned to you by Figma and is typically obtained using the "Create new Plugin" feature, which will generate a manifest file with a new `id`. You can also get a new plugin ID at the time of publishing your plugin.

---

##### api: string

The version of the Figma API used by the plugin. **We recommend updating to the latest version whenever possible** to get the latest features, bug fixes, and documentation. However, we don't auto-upgrade the api version of plugins to give you the chance to test your plugin against the new version.

---

##### main: string

The relative file path to the Javascript code of your plugin.

---

##### ui?: string | { [key: string]: string }

Used to specify HTML file/files that can be used in the iframe modal via `figma.show UI`, if you choose to have one.

- If a single string is specified, this is the relative file path to the HTML file whose contents will be available as a string in the Javascript code via the constant `__html__`.
- If a map is specified, each entry of the map will be available at `__ui Files__`

---

##### documentAccess?: 'dynamic-page'

This field ensures the plugin supports dynamic page loading. The field is required for all new plugins and the value must be `dynamic-page`.

- If the manifest field is included, no additional page loads will occur when the plugin is run.
- If the manifest field is omitted, then running the plugin will trigger additional page loads in files with more than one page. The first time the plugin is run after a user opens a file, the entire file will load and Figma will show a "Loading n pages for plugin…" notification, where `n` is the number of pages being loaded.

If your existing plugin's manifest doesn't include this field, you should migrate your plugin to use dynamic page loading.

---

##### networkAccess?: NetworkAccess

Used to specify the list of domains that your plugin is permitted to access. When `networkAccess` is used:

- Your plugin can only access the domains that you specify. If your plugin attempts to access other domains, the plugin is prevented from doing so.

The enforcement of network access is limited only to requests made by the plugin, such as requests to a public API. In a situation such as a plugin rendering a website in a frame, network access limits only apply to the website's domain. Network access limits don’t affect the website’s resources.

- The list of domains that your plugin can access is displayed on your plugin's Community page.


`networkAccess` has the following properties:

- `allowedDomains` is a required list of strings. The strings are match patterns for domains that your plugin is permitted to access. If `networkAccess` is used, `allowedDomains`must include at least one pattern. Optionally, patterns can start with one of the permitted schemes: `http`, `https`, `ws`, or `wss`. The `*` character may be used as a wildcard for subdomains, or used to represent all domains.
- `reasoning` is a usually-optional string that describes why your plugin needs to access the allowed domains. `reasoning` is required if:
- Your `allowedDomains` list includes `"*"`
- Your `allowedDomains` list includes local or development servers. If you only need local or development servers for development, please use `devAllowedDomains`instead.
- `devAllowedDomains` is an optional list of strings. The strings are match patterns for domains that your plugin is permitted to access during development. You can use most of the same patterns in `devAllowedDomains` as you can in `allowedDomains`.

Valid patterns for `allowedDomains`:

- `["none"]`: The plugin cannot access any external network resources. Note that we preload the Inter font for use in plugins, so you don't need to include an Inter font source in your allowedDomains.

Valid patterns for `allowedDomains` and `devAllowedDomains`:

- `["*"]`: The plugin may access any external network resources. If this pattern is included in `allowedDomains`, the `reasoning` property is required.
- `["*.example.com"]`: The `*` character can be used to permit all subdomains of a given domain.
- `["http://example.com", "https://example.com", "ws://example.com", "wss://example.com"]`: `http`, `https`, `ws`, and `wss` are permitted schemes that can be used to prefix domains. Other schemes, such as `file`, cannot be used.
- `["api.example.com/rest/get", "www.example.com/images/", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/example_bucket/"]`: URLs to specific resources can be used.
- `["example.com", "figma.com"]`: Domains can be used without schemes, subdomains, or wildcards.
- `["http://localhost", "https://localhost", "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8081"]`: During development, the plugin can access a local/development web server. If the server is running on a port other than port 80, the port number can be provided after the URL. If this pattern is included in `allowedDomains`, the `reasoning` property is required.

In the previous example, the trailing slash in `www.example.com/images/` identifies a path to multiple resources. For example, `www.example.com/images/` lets a plugin access images at `www.example.com/images/img1.png` and `www.example.com/images/img2.png`.

A pattern with _no_ trailing slash blocks any deeper access to files on that path. For example, `api.example.com/rest/get` stops a plugin from accessing `api.example.com/rest/get/exampleresource.json`. This can be useful, for example, if your plugin uses a REST API endpoint and you want to restrict the plugin to that endpoint only.

For example:

```
"networkAccess": { "allowedDomains": [ "figma.com", "*.google.com", "https://my-app.cdn.com", "wss://socket.io", "example.com/api/", "exact-path.com/content" ], "devAllowedDomains": [ "http://localhost:3000" ]}
```

More formally,

```
interface NetworkAccess { allowedDomains: string[] reasoning?: string devAllowedDomains: string[]}
```

---

##### parameters?: Parameter[]

Used to specify the list of parameters that your plugin accepts as input. Can also be defined on menu items. Here's an example:

```
"parameters": [ { "name": "Icon name", "key": "icon-name", "description": "Enter the name of the icon you want to insert." }, { "name": "Size", "key": "size", "description": "Enter the size of the icon you want to insert.", "allowFreeform": true }, { "name": "Color", "key": "color", "description": "Enter the color of the icon you want to insert.", "allowFreeform": true, "optional": true }]
```

Each parameter has the following properties:

- A `name` property that specifies the name given to this parameter in the UI.
- A `key` property that is a unique id used to identify the value of this property in `Parameter Values`.
- An optional `description` property that gives a more detailed description that is displayed in the UI.
- An optional `allowFreeform` property that allows the user to enter any value for this parameter, not just those suggested by the plugin.
- An optional `optional` property that indicates the parameter can be skipped in the UI.

More formally,

```
interface Parameter { name: string key: string description?: string allowFreeform?: boolean optional?: boolean}
```

---

##### parameterOnly?: boolean

Allows you to specify that your plugin can only be launched with parameters. You must also specify a valid parameter list: `parameters`. Can also be defined on menu items with parameters.

If `true`, users will always be prompted to enter parameters in the quick action UI before your plugin is run. If `false`, users will only be asked to enter parameters if they launch the plugin through the Quick Actions UI and hit the `tab` key. If the user launches the plugin through the context menu or the main menu, the plugin will be launched directly without displaying the parameter UI.

Defaults to `true`

---

##### editorType: ('figma' | 'figjam' | 'dev')[]

This allows you to specify the editor(s) that your plugin is intended for and will impact which editor your plugin appears in.

|editorType|description|
|---|---|
|`"figma"`|Figma design mode|
|`"figjam"`|FigJam|
|`"dev"`|Figma Dev Mode|

The following value is unsupported:

```
"editorType": ["figjam", "dev"]
```

---

##### menu?: ManifestMenuItem[]

This allows you to specify a submenu for your plugin, enabling the plugin to contain multiple commands. Use the `figma.command` property to determine which command the user selected.

The `menu` property contains a nested list of menu items, menu separators and submenus to be displayed. Here's an example:

```
"menu": [ {"name": "Create Text", "command": "text"}, {"name": "Create Frame", "command": "frame"}, {"separator": true}, {"name": "Create Shape", "menu": [ {"name": "Create Circle", "command": "circle"}, {"separator": true}, {"name": "Create Rectangle", "command": "rectangle"} ] }]
```

Each item in the `menu` property must be one of the following three:

- A `name` and a `command` property. This creates a user-clickable submenu item. The `name`property is displayed to the user in the menu. The `command` property is never exposed to the user but is rather exposed to your plugin through the `figma.command` javascript property. You can choose any string value for `command`.
- A `separator` property with the value `true`. This creates a separator in the menu. A separator is not selectable by the user.
- A `name` and a `menu` property. This creates a nested submenu. The `name` property is displayed as name for the submenu. The `menu` property contains an array of menu items following the same format of the top-most `menu` manifest property. The submenu itself can not be selected by the user, but items inside the submenu can be. Submenus can be nested arbitrarily deep.

More formally,

```
type ManifestMenuItem = // Clickable menu item. { name: string, command: string, parameters?: ParameterList[], parameterOnly?: boolean } | // Separator { separator: true } | // Submenu { name: string, menu: ManifestMenuItem[] }
```

---

##### relaunchButtons?: ManifestRelaunchButton[]

This configures the relaunch buttons that are set via the `set Relaunch Data` API call.

Example:

```
"relaunchButtons": [ {"command": "edit", "name": "Edit shape"}, {"command": "open", "name": "Open Shaper", "multipleSelection": true}]
```

Each relaunch button in the `relaunchButtons` array is an object with the following properties:

- A `command` property that specifies the `figma.command` that will be supplied when the plugin is run after the button is pressed. This command must match the command supplied in the `set Relaunch Data` API call for the button to display.
- A `name` property that gets displayed as the text of the button.
- An optional `multipleSelection` property (defaulting to `false`) that enables the relaunch button and description to appear when multiple nodes are selected. Without `multipleSelection` set to `true` the relaunch buttons will only appear when a single node is selected. Even when `multipleSelection` is `true`, the relaunch buttons will only display if all of the selected nodes have relaunch data attached with the same `command`.

Note that if the name of a command in the manifest changes or is removed, then all buttons with that command will disappear. This behavior can be used to remove buttons when a particular action is no longer supported by the plugin.

If multiple relaunch buttons are shown for a given node or selection of nodes, the order of the buttons is determined by the order of the elements in the manifest's `relaunchButtons`array.

More formally,

```
type ManifestRelaunchButton = { command: string name: string multipleSelection?: boolean}
```

---

##### enableProposedApi?: boolean

See Proposed API. **Warning: This flag is only meant for development, and will not work in published plugins!**

---

##### enablePrivatePluginApi?: boolean

This enables API that's specific to private plugins. Setting this will also enable local plugins to work with these APIs during development.

---

##### build?: string

**Experimental!** A shell command to run before we load the file specified in `main` and `ui`. This can be used to call build commands such as compiling with Typescript, running Webpack, etc. The command is run in the directory of the manifest.

---

##### permissions?: PluginPermissionType[]

This allows you to specify what permissions your plugin wants access to.

The possible `PluginPermissionType` are:

```
type PluginPermissionType = "currentuser" | "activeusers" | "fileusers" | "payments" | "teamlibrary"
```

- `activeusers`: lets your plugin use the `figma.active Users` API.
- `currentuser`: lets your plugin use the `figma.current User` API.
- `fileusers`: lets you use the `Stamp Node.get Author Async` method.
- `payments`: lets you use the `figma.payments` API.
- `teamlibrary`: lets you use the `figma.team Library` API.

---

##### capabilities?: ('textreview' | 'codegen' | 'inspect' | 'vscode')[]

This allows you to specify what capabilities your plugin has access to.

You can specify one or more of the following values:

- `textreview`
- `codegen`
- `inspect`

Use `textreview` for text review plugins.

Use `codegen` for codegen plugins.

Use `inspect` for inspect panel plugins.

Use `vscode` for Dev Mode plugins in VS Code.

---

##### codegenLanguages?: [CodeLanguage](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodeLanguage/)[]

A list of code languages that your plugin supports. This is required for codegen plugins (plugins where `editorType` is `dev`, and `capabilities` is `inspect`).

Example:

```
// Specify which languages the plugin supports."codegenLanguages": [ { label: "Tailwind", value: "tailwind" }, { label: "CSS", value: "css" },]
```

---

##### codegenPreferences?: [CodegenPreference](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenPreference/)[]

Used to specify a list of preferences for your codegen plugin, such as alternative units of measure.

Example:

```
"codegenPreferences": [ // Optional but a unit itemType can be used to specify that the plugin supports a custom scaled unit. By default, all plugins // support the pixel unit. { "itemType": "unit", "scaledUnit": "Rem", "defaultScaleFactor": 16, // Optional, if true the scaled unit is the default. "default": true, // Optional, if omitted, all languages are included. "includedLanguages": [] }, { "itemType": "select", "propertyName": "tabSize", "label": "Tab Size", "options": [ {"label": "2", "value": "2", isDefault: true }, {"label": "4", "value": "4"}, {"label": "8", "value": "8"} ], // Optional, if omitted, all languages are included. "includedLanguages": ["tailwind"] }, { "itemType": "action", "propertyName": "showMore", "label": "More settings..." // Optional, if omitted, all languages are included. "includedLanguages": ["tailwind"], },]
```

### The Typings File

While the written documentation can help you explore the API and explain how it works, the typings file provide TypeScript annotation that can be used to assist you directly when coding. Used with an editor like VSCode, it provides API suggestions while you're typing and lets you know when you missed an edge case.

To get the latest typings, run `npm install --save-dev @figma/plugin-typings`.

You will also need to add the typings directory to your `tsconfig.json` using the `typeRoots`option. Plugins created from the default template will already have this included:

```
{ "compilerOptions": { ... "typeRoots": [ "./node_modules/@types", "./node_modules/@figma" ] }}
```

We strongly recommend enabling strict mode so that TypeScript can help you catch more errors eg. when a variable might be null. You can do this by adding the following option to your `tsconfig.json`.

```
{ "compilerOptions": { ... "strict": true }}
```

##### Linting for typings

Linting, the automated validation of source code for issues, can be very helpful for catching errors early in the development of your plugin. We provide a set of typescript-eslint rules on GitHub to help support plugin development. These rules can identify, and in many cases automatically fix, issues in your plugin code. The GitHub repository includes detailed instructions for installing and using the rules to test your plugin code.

### API Errors

Like any software, Figma enforces that any file you create is _valid_. For example, we make sure there's no way for a user to make "Frame A" the parent of "Frame B" _and_ make "Frame B" the parent of "Frame A" at the same time. We enforce these restrictions by limiting the actions that you can take. Similarly, we make sure that plugins can't create invalid content in files by throwing **errors** or **exceptions** if an operation is invalid.

A key part of building a high quality plugin is getting familiar with these restrictions. That way, your plugin won't crash if a someone uses it in a way you didn't intend.

These restrictions are documented here, as well as in the pages of various properties and functions in the **reference**.

#### Invalid Operations

Functions that take arguments and property setters always have restrictions on what kind of values you can give them. For example, `opacity` can only be set to a number, and it must also be a number between 0 and 1. So, if your plugin includes the below sample code, the following error will be returned: `Error: in set_opacity: Expected "opacity" to have type number but got string instead`.

```
figma.currentPage.selection[0].opacity = "test"
```

##### General Patterns of Errors

Here are some additional patterns of errors and invalid operations to be aware of:

**Writing to Node Properties:** Plugins in Dev Mode cannot edit the layers in a file (otherwise referred to as "nodes"), with the exception of certain metadata. And across other editor types, some nodes are read-only. Therefore, attempting to edit properties that are not editable will result in this error: `Cannot write to internal and read-only nodes`. Learn more in the reference, as well as the Working in Dev Mode → and Working in Fig Jam → guides.
- **Overriding Properties on Instance Nodes:** Some properties on the Instance Node type can be overridden, while others cannot be. For example, you can't change the order of children in an instance, or their position. Therefore, attempting to override a property that can't be overridden will result in this error: `This property cannot be overriden on an instance`. Learn more about applying overrides to instances →.
- **Writing to Text Properties:** Many text properties require the font of that TextNode to be loaded before they can be set. Therefore, attempting to write to text properties before the required font is loaded will result in the following error: `Cannot write to node with unloaded font "[font]"`. Learn more in the Working with Text → guide.
- **Using properties and methods that aren't compatible with dynamic page loading:** some synchronous operations in the Plugin API aren't compatible with dynamic page loading. If a plugin has the `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"` manifest field, using these operations will trigger an error of type `Cannot call with documentAccess: dynamic-page. Use figma.getNodeByIdAsync() instead`. Learn more in the Migrating Plugins to Dynamically Load Pages → guide.
- **Calling a method on an unloaded page:** If the plugin manifest contains the `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"` field, the plugin must explicitly load pages as needed. Using a method on a page has not been loaded will result in the following type of error: `Cannot access children on a page that has not been explicitly loaded. Remember to call` await page.loadAsync()`or`await figma.loadAllPagesAsync() `first`. Learn more in the Migrating Plugins to Dynamically Load Pages → guide.

## Global Objects
You can access most of the Plugin API through the `figma` global object. You'll find properties and functions that allow you to view, create, and update the contents of files.

- View and update file-level properties, like thumbnails, undo history, and version history
- Create, copy, or combine layers
- Adjust properties of existing layers
- Create, use, and manage local styles
- Access users in the file
- Import styles and component from external libraries

Example:

```
figma.createRectangle()figma.closePlugin()
```

Tip: The `figma` global object is available in every Figma window. This means you can open the developer console in any file and access the API. This is a great way to explore the functionality of the API without having to create a plugin. You can also use this approach to test and debug your plugin code.

There are several other global objects available. You can access these from methods on the `figma` global object:

- `figma.ui` to create a custom interface for your plugin
- `figma.codegen` to implement code generation in Dev Mode
- `figma.timer` to control the timer object in FigJam files
- `figma.viewport` to control the viewport: the area of the canvas that's visible on screen
- `figma.client Storage` to store data on a user's local machine
- `figma.parameters` to accept parameters as input
- `figma.variables` to interact with variables
- `figma.team Library` to interact with assets in a team library
- `figma.textreview` to interact with features only available to text review plugins

There are also global variables available across the Plugin API:

### figma

These are methods and properties available on the `figma` global object.

#### General

##### apiVersion: '1.0.0' [readonly]

The version of the Figma API this plugin is running on, as defined in your `manifest.json` in the `"api"` field.

---

##### fileKey: string | undefined [readonly]

The file key of the current file this plugin is running on. **Only private plugins and Figma-owned resources (such as the Jira and Asana widgets) have access to this.** To enable this behavior, you need to specify `enablePrivatePluginApi` in your `manifest.json`.

---

##### command: string [readonly]

The currently executing command from the `manifest.json` file. It is the command string in the `ManifestMenuItem` (more details in the manifest guide). If the plugin does not have any menu item, this property is undefined.

---

##### pluginId?: string [readonly]

The value specified in the `manifest.json` "id" field. This only exists for Plugins.

---

##### widgetId?: string [readonly]

Similar to `figma.pluginId` but for widgets. The value specified in the `manifest.json` "id" field. This only exists for Widgets.

---

##### editorType: 'figma' | 'figjam' | 'dev' | 'slides' | 'buzz' [readonly]

The current editor type this plugin is running in. See also Setting editor type.

---

##### [mode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-mode/): 'default' | 'textreview' | 'inspect' | 'codegen' | 'linkpreview' | 'auth' [readonly]

Return the context the plugin is current running in.

- `default` - The plugin is running as a normal plugin.
- `textreview` - The plugin is running to provide text review functionality.
- `inspect` - The plugin is running in the Inspect panel in Dev Mode.
- `codegen` - The plugin is running in the Code section of the Inspect panel in Dev Mode.
- `linkpreview` - The plugin is generating a link preview for a Dev resource in Dev Mode.
- `auth` - The plugin is running to authenticate a user in Dev Mode.

The `linkpreview` and `auth` modes are only available to partner and Figma-owned plugins.



---

##### [skipInvisibleInstanceChildren](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-skipinvisibleinstancechildren/): boolean

When enabled, causes all node properties and methods to skip over invisible nodes (and their descendants) inside `instances`. This makes operations like document traversal much faster.

Defaults to true in Figma Dev Mode and false in Figma and FigJam



---

##### currentPage: [PageNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/PageNode/)

The page that the user currently viewing. You can set this value to a `Page Node` to switch pages.

- If the manifest contains`"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, this property is read-only. Use `figma.set Current Page Async` to update the value.

---

##### `setCurrentPageAsync(page: [PageNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/PageNode/)): Promise<void>`

---

##### [createVideoAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-createvideoasync/)(data: Uint8Array): Promise<[Video](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Video/)>

Creates a `Video` object from the raw bytes of a file content. Like `Image` objects, `Video`objects **are not nodes**. They are handles to images stored by Figma. Frame backgrounds, or fills of shapes (e.g. a rectangle) may contain videos.



---

##### [mixed](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-mixed/): unique symbol [readonly]

This a constant value that some node properties return when they are a mix of multiple values. An example might be font size: a single text node can use multiple different font sizes for different character ranges. For those properties, you should always compare against `figma.mixed`.

---

##### getFileThumbnailNode(): [FrameNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/FrameNode/) | [ComponentNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/ComponentNode/) | [ComponentSetNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/ComponentSetNode/) | [SectionNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/SectionNode/) | null

**DEPRECATED:** Use `figma.get File Thumbnail Node Async` instead. This function will throw an exception if the plugin manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`.

Gets the node that is currently being used for file thumbnail, or null if the default thumbnail is used.

---

##### `setFileThumbnailNodeAsync(node: [FrameNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/FrameNode/) | [ComponentNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/ComponentNode/) | [ComponentSetNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/ComponentSetNode/) | [SectionNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/SectionNode/) | null): Promise<void>`

Set `node` to be the thumbnail for the file. If `node` is null, then use the default thumbnail.

---

##### `loadAllPagesAsync(): Promise<void>`

Loads all pages of the document into memory. This enables the use of the following features:

- The `documentchange` event for `figma.on`
- `find All`
- `find One`
- `find All With Criteria`
- `find Widget Nodes By Widget Id`

Calling this method may be slow for large documents, and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

This method is only necessary if the plugin manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`. Without this manifest setting, the full document is loaded automatically when the plugin or widget runs.

##### **html**

If you assigned a file name to the `"ui"` field in your `manifest.json` file, you can use this variable to access the file's contents.

Instead of including HTML within a JavaScript string, you can call `figma.showUI(__html__)` . As the HTML is in a separate file, your text editor will render the HTML with syntax highlighting.

##### **uiFiles**

If you assigned a map to the `"ui"` field in your `manifest.json` file:

```
"ui": { "main": "main.html", "secondary": "secondary.html"}
```

you can use this variable to access each file's contents. You can then call `figma.showUI(__uiFiles__.main)`.

##### [fetch](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/global-fetch/)(url: string, init?: [FetchOptions](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/global-fetch/#fetch-options)): Promise<[FetchResponse](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/global-fetch/#fetch-response)>

#### Parameters

##### pluginMessage

This can be almost any data type or plain object, as long as it's a serializable object.

This is similar to saying that it should be possible to send the object over a network if it were necessary. You can send objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, Date objects and Uint8Array objects. However, functions and prototype chains of objects will not be sent.

These restrictions are the same as the browser's `postMessage`: click here for more details.

##### options

An object that may contain the following optional parameters:

- `origin`: An advanced option, mainly used for implementing OAuth. If the `origin` option is provided, the message will only be delivered to the iframe if the origin of the document inside the iframe matches the `origin`. This defaults to `'*'`, which allows the message to be passed to any document.

Creates an `RGB` color object from a variety of common color encodings.

**Note**: since `RGB` colors are primarily used for creating `SolidPaint` objects, you might want to use `solid Paint` instead.

Accepted color formats include CSS color strings with hex, `rgb()`, `hsl()`, or `lab()`encodings, as well as `RGB` and `RGBA` objects. Alpha values in the input will be ignored. If a string encoding cannot be parsed, an error will be thrown.

Examples:

```
const color1 = figma.util.rgb('#FF00FF')const color2 = figma.util.rgb('hsl(25% 50% 75%)')
```

You can alias this function for more concise code:

```
const rgb = figma.util.rgbconst color = rgb('#FF00FF')
```



---

##### rgba(color: string | [RGB](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/RGB/) | [RGBA](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/RGB/#rgba)): [RGBA](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/RGB/#rgba)

##### solidPaint(color: string | [RGB](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/RGB/) | [RGBA](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/RGB/#rgba), overrides?: Partial<[SolidPaint](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Paint/#solid-paint)>): [SolidPaint](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Paint/#solid-paint)

Creates a `SolidPaint` object, assigning color and opacity from a variety of common color encodings.

Accepted color formats include CSS color strings with hex, `rgb()`, `hsl()`, or `lab()`encodings, as well as `RGB` and `RGBA` objects. The resulting alpha value will be applied to the `SolidPaint`'s `opacity` property, which defaults to 1 (opaque) if not specified. If a string encoding cannot be parsed, an error will be thrown.

Optionally, you can provide a set of overrides for any of the non-color properties of the `SolidPaint` object. This is useful for modifying the color of an existing `SolidPaint` while preserving its other properties.

Examples:

```
// Set the current page background to redfigma.currentPage.backgrounds = [figma.util.solidPaint("#FF0000")]// Modify an existing SolidPaint with new color and opacityif (node.fills[0].type === 'SOLID') { const updated = figma.util.solidPaint('#FF00FF88', node.fills[0])}

Normalizes the markdown string to verify what markdown will render with Figma's rich-text editors.

Examples:

```
const md = "# Hello, world!\n\nThis is a **bold** text."const normalizedMd = figma.util.normalizeMarkdown(md);// Set an component description with descriptionMarkdowncomponent.descriptionMarkdown = normalizedMd;
```

#### Signature

##### normalizeMarkdown(markdown: string): string

#### Parameters

##### markdown

A markdown string to normalize.

### figma.constants

These are the properties available on the `figma.constants` global object.

##### colors: [ColorPalettes](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/ColorPalettes/)

Holds color palettes, which maps color names to hex codes.

Example usage

```
const colorMapBase = figma.constants.colors.figJamBaseconst colorMapBaseLight = figma.constants.colors.figJamBaseLight
```

### figma.codegen

This API is only available in Figma Dev Mode

Plugins in Dev Mode can extend Figma's native code snippets to generate code for languages or frameworks that Figma doesn’t support, or to surface metadata that a front-end developer might find useful when implementing a design in code (e.g. where to import icons in a codebase or internationalization string extraction).

Plugins in Dev Mode specifically built for code generation ("codegen") appear in the Figma's native language dropdown. Once selected from this menu, the `figma.codegen.on("generate")` callback will get called any time the user's selection changes.

If you are building a plugin specifically for code generation, then you need to add the following to your manifest.

Add the following properties to your manifest.json

```
{ "editorType": ["dev"], "capabilities": ["codegen"]}
```

These are methods and properties available on the `figma.codegen` object:

##### [on](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-codegen-on/)(type: 'generate', callback: (event: [CodegenEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenEvent/)) => Promise<[CodegenResult](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenResult/)[]> | [CodegenResult](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenResult/)[]): void

##### `[on](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-codegen-on/)(type: 'preferenceschange', callback: (event: [CodegenPreferencesEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenPreferencesEvent/)) => Promise<void>): void`

A plugin for code generation needs to call `figma.codegen.on('generate')` to register a callback that will be called when a user's selection changes in Dev Mode. This callback should return an array of JSON objects that represent the sections in the Inspect panel. The callback has a 15 second timeout and returns an error if it times out. For more information, see the remarks.



---

##### once(type: 'generate', callback: (event: [CodegenEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenEvent/)) => Promise<[CodegenResult](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenResult/)[]> | [CodegenResult](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenResult/)[]): void

##### `once(type: 'preferenceschange', callback: (event: [CodegenPreferencesEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenPreferencesEvent/)) => Promise<void>): void`

Same as `figma.codegen.on`, but the callback only gets called the first time.

---

##### off(type: 'generate', callback: (event: [CodegenEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenEvent/)) => Promise<[CodegenResult](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenResult/)[]> | [CodegenResult](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenResult/)[]): void

##### `off(type: 'preferenceschange', callback: (event: [CodegenPreferencesEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenPreferencesEvent/)) => Promise<void>): void`

Removes a callback added by `figma.codegen.on` or `figma.codegen.once`.

---

##### preferences: [CodegenPreferences](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenPreference/#codegen-preferences) [readonly]

Read the current preferences as specified by the user.

```
type CodegenPreferences = { readonly unit: 'PIXEL' | 'SCALED' readonly scaleFactor?: number // An object for every "select" item and their currently // selected values. The format of this is "select" item // propertyName => selectedOption.value. readonly customSettings: Record<string, string>}
```

---

##### refresh: () => void

Triggers the `figma.codegen.on("generate")` callback again.

This is is useful for plugins that need to refresh the codegen output. For example, if you’re using an iframe to provide more customization options.

### on

A plugin for code generation needs to call `figma.codegen.on('generate')` to register a callback that will be called when a user's selection changes in Dev Mode. This callback should return an array of JSON objects that represent the sections in the Inspect panel. The callback has a 15 second timeout and returns an error if it times out. For more information, see the remarks.

#### Signature

##### [on](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-codegen-on/)(type: 'generate', callback: (event: [CodegenEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenEvent/)) => Promise<[CodegenResult](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenResult/)[]> | [CodegenResult](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenResult/)[]): void

##### `[on](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-codegen-on/)(type: 'preferenceschange', callback: (event: [CodegenPreferencesEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodegenPreferencesEvent/)) => Promise<void>): void`

#### Parameters

##### type

The type of event to add the callback for: 'generate' or 'preferenceschange'.

##### callback

The callback that is called when the event is triggered.

#### Remarks

This callback can be async if your plugin needs to do some data fetching or other async operation to generate code.

`figma.showUI` is not allowed within the generate callback. Instead, if `figma.show UI`is required in the generate callback, the `showUI` call should be moved outside of the callback and `figma.ui.post Message` should be used within the callback instead. This ensures that the plugin is able to handle concurrent "generate" events.

A plugin can also register a callback to handle events when codegen preferences are modified. This is useful for codegenPreferences that need to open an iframe to get more user input.

Only preferences with `itemType: "action"` will trigger the `"preferenceschange"`` callback.

The callback has a 15 second timeout. If the callback registered by `figma.codegen.on('generate')` doesn't return a value within 15 seconds (for example, if the array of JSON objects takes too long to construct), the operation ends and an error message is sent to the console:

Callback timeout error

```
code generation timed out after 15 seconds
```

Additionally, a notification appears in the Code section of the Inspect panel to alert the plugin's user of the error:

Inspect panel timeout error

```
<Plugin name> ran into an issueThis plugin is created by a third party and notmaintained by Figma, so to give feedback pleasereach out to the developer.
```

The error in the Inspect panel includes a link to your plugin's community page.

### figma.timer

This API is only available in FigJam

These are methods and properties available on the `figma.timer` global object. It represents the built-in timer that is available in FigJam. If the plugin is not running in a FigJam document, this object will not be available.

##### remaining: number [readonly]

Time remaining on timer, in seconds. If the timer has not been started, returns 0.

---

##### total: number [readonly]

Total time on timer, in seconds. If the timer has not been started, returns 0. The total time is defined as the time the timer was initially started at, plus or minus any time that may have been added or removed from the timer.

---

##### state: 'STOPPED' | 'PAUSED' | 'RUNNING' [readonly]

The current state of the timer. If the timer is started and not paused, the state will be `"RUNNING"`. If the timer is not started or finished, the state is `"STOPPED"`. And if the timer is started but paused, the state is `"PAUSED"`.

---

##### pause: () => void

Pause the timer. If the timer has not been started, does nothing.

---

##### resume: () => void

Resume the timer. If the timer is not currently started and paused, does nothing.

---

##### start: (seconds: number) => void

Start the timer with `seconds` seconds remaining. If the timer is not currently started, will start the timer with this total time. If the timer is currently started, will set the remaining time to this value, and increment or decrement the timer's total time based on how much time was added or removed from the remaining time. If the timer was previously paused, will also unpause the timer.

---

##### stop: () => void

Stops the timer. If the timer was not started or is finished, does nothing.

### figma.viewport

These are methods and properties available on the `figma.viewport` global object. It represents the area of the canvas that is currently visible on-screen, commonly referred to as the **viewport**. The position of the viewport is represented via its center coordinate and zoom level.

##### center: [Vector](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Vector/)

Center of the the current page that is currently visible on screen.

---

##### [zoom](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-viewport-zoom/): number

Zoom level. A value of 1.0 means 100% zoom, 0.5 means 50% zoom.



---

##### scrollAndZoomIntoView(nodes: ReadonlyArray<[BaseNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#base-node)>): void

Automatically sets the viewport coordinates such that the nodes are visible on screen. It is the equivalent of pressing Shift-1.

---

##### bounds: [Rect](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Rect/) [readonly]

The bounds of the viewport of the page that is currently visible on screen. The (x, y) corresponds to the top-left of the screen. User actions such as resizing the window or showing/hiding the rulers/UI will change the bounds of the viewport.

---

##### [slidesView](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-viewport-slidesview/): 'grid' | 'single-slide'

This API is only available in Figma Slides



---

##### [canvasView](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-viewport-canvasview/): 'grid' | 'single-asset'

This API is only available in Figma Slides and Figma Buzz

### zoom

Zoom level. A value of 1.0 means 100% zoom, 0.5 means 50% zoom.

#### Signature

##### [zoom](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-viewport-zoom/): number

#### Remarks

- zoom < 1: design is zoomed out
- zoom = 1: design is shown at exact size
- zoom > 1: design is zoomed in

### slidesView

This API is only available in Figma Slides

#### Signature

##### [slidesView](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-viewport-slidesview/): 'grid' | 'single-slide'

#### Remarks

The viewport mode within the Slides UI: In Single Slide View, the viewport is zoomed into the current slide, and we only render that one slide. In Grid View, the viewport is zoomed out to show the entire slide grid.

You can access the current view:

```
const currentView = figma.viewport.slidesView
```

And you can set the view:

```
figma.viewport.slidesView = 'single-slide'
```

##### A Note About Single Slide View:

We have updated all of the create methods (`figma.createRectangle()`, `figma.createLine()`, etc) so that when the Figma Slides file is in Single Slide View, they append that node to the focused slide instead of to the canvas. This is to ensure that the node you are creating is viewable by the current user and not hidden off to the side of the larger grid view.

### canvasView

This API is only available in Figma Slides and Figma Buzz

#### Signature

##### [canvasView](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-viewport-canvasview/): 'grid' | 'single-asset'

#### Remarks

The viewport mode within the Slides and Buzz UI: In Asset View, the viewport is zoomed into the current asset or slide, and we only render that one asset/slide. In Grid View, the viewport is zoomed out to show the entire canvas grid.

You can access the current view:

```
const currentView = figma.viewport.canvasView
```

And you can set the view:

```
figma.viewport.canvasView = 'single-asset'
```

##### A Note About Asset View:

We have updated all of the create methods (`figma.createRectangle()`, `figma.createLine()`, etc) so that when the Figma Slides/Buzz file is in Asset View, they append that node to the focused asset/slide instead of to the canvas. This is to ensure that the node you are creating is viewable by the current user and not hidden off to the side of the larger grid view.

### figma.clientStorage

The `figma.clientStorage` API allows you to store data on the user's local machine. Unlike data stored with the document (such as `set Plugin Data`), this data is not synchronized across users. It's similar to the Window.local Storage API, but is asynchronous, and allows storing objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined and `Uint8Array`. Like `localStorage`, you should expect that user actions such as clearing the browser cache might clear all stored data.

The data is specific to your plugin ID. Plugins with other IDs won't be able to read this data.

Each plugin gets a total of 5MB of storage. You can approximate the quota used by a key/value pair by adding the size of the key to the size of the value converted to JSON. The main exception is that Uint8Array values counts as the size of the Uint8Array, rather than the array converted to JSON.

> ⚠ The data is stored privately for **stability**, not **security**. It prevents other plugins from accessing with your data. It does not, however, prevent users from seeing data stored on their own client given sufficient effort.

> ⚠ Data will become inaccessible if your plugin ID changes.

##### getAsync(key: string): Promise<any | undefined>

Retrieves a value from client storage with the given `key`. If no value has been stored for that key, this function will asynchronously return `undefined`.

---

##### `setAsync(key: string, value: any): Promise<void>`

Sets a value to client storage with the given `key`. The returned promise will resolve if storage is successful, or reject with an error message if storage failed.

---

##### `deleteAsync(key: string): Promise<void>`

Removes the stored key/value pair from client storage with the given `key`. If no such key is stored, this function will return normally but will otherwise do nothing.

---

##### keysAsync(): Promise<string[]>

Retrieves a list of all keys stored to client storage. Use this to enumerate the full contents of the clientStorage API.

### figma.parameters

These are methods and properties available on the `figma.parameters` global object. See Accepting Parameters as Input for more details.

```
type ParameterInputEvent<T = ParameterValues> = { query: string, key: string, parameters: Partial<T>, result: SuggestionResults,}
```

The `input` event is fired on every key press as the user is entering parameters for a plugin in quick actions. The expectation is that plugin will respond to these events by calling one of the APIs `result` object.

##### on(type: 'input', callback: (event: [ParameterInputEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-parameters/#parameter-input-event)) => void): void

Register a handler for user input events in the quick action UI.

---

##### once(type: 'input', callback: (event: [ParameterInputEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-parameters/#parameter-input-event)) => void): void

Register a handler for user input events in the quick action UI. Same as `figma.parameters.on("input")`, but only gets called the first time.

---

##### off(type: 'input', callback: (event: [ParameterInputEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-parameters/#parameter-input-event)) => void): void

Removes a handler added via `figma.parameters.on`.

---

#### SuggestionResults

The `result` object passed to the `'input'` event handler contains API for controlling the UI that the user sees while entering parameter values. Most importantly it is able to provide the list of autocomplete suggestions that the user can choose from as they type.

But the `result` object also enables showing error messages and loading states.

##### setSuggestions(suggestions: Array<string | { name: string; data: any; icon: string | Uint8Array; iconUrl: string }>): void

Sets the list of autocomplete suggestions to be displayed in the quick action UI.

If you only want to provide a string suggestion, and don't need metadata or icons, you can use an array of simple string values. For example

Simple string suggestions

```
figma.parameters.on('input', ({ query, result }) => { result.setSuggestions( ["Armadillo", "Baboon", "Cacatua", "Dolphin"] .filter(s => s.includes(query)))})
```

However the API also allows providing more information with each suggestion:

- The text to display to the user
- An icon (optional)
- Hidden metadata which is passed back to the plugin if the user chooses this suggestion (optional)

Example

Suggestions with icons and data

```
result.setSuggestions([ { name: node1.name, data: node1.id, icon: node1Preview }, { name: node2.name, data: node2.id, icon: node2Preview }, ...])
```

The `name` property contains the text to display to the user in the autocomplete suggestions. This property is required.

The `data` property allows associating hidden metadata with a given autocomplete suggestion. This data is passed back to the plugin as the parameter's value if the user chooses this option. If no `data` property is provided, it defaults to the value of the `name`property. I.e. the value of the parameter will be the string that was displayed to the user.

An icon can be provided through a `icon` or `iconUrl` property. The `icon` property can contain either a raster image in the form of a `Uint8Array`, or an SVG image in the form of a string. You can alternatively use the `iconUrl` property to provide a URL to the image. Note that for this to work the target server has to support CORS.

---

##### setError(message: string): void

Displays an error message to the user instead of a list of autocomplete suggestions. When this function is called, the user is prevented from moving on to the next parameter without first changing the input for the current parameter.

This is useful to signal to the user that they have entered an invalid value and provide them instruction for how to correct the input.

You can also use this as a way to validate pre-conditions, like current selection, or some state of the current document. To do this, in the 'input' event handler for the first parameter key, check the that all pre-conditions are fulfilled and call `setError` with an appropriate error message if they are not, unconditionally of what the current `query` value is.

This function is _not_ available on parameters with `allowFreeform` set. The purpose of `allowFreeform` is to allow users to enter arbitrary values and so Figma doesn't guarantee that the plugin gets an opportunity to handle an input event and call `setError` before the user moves on to the next parameter.

If you want to generally allow freeform input, but still retain the ability to call `setError`, you can remove `allowFreeform` and manually add a autocomplete entry containing the current `query` string. I.e. make the first item in the array passed to `setSuggestions` simply be the string in `query`.

For a full example of what this can look like, see the Resizer sample plugin

---

##### setLoadingMessage(message: string): void

Modify the default "Loading Suggestions..." message displayed until the plugin calls `setSuggestions`. This can be useful if your plugin needs to load autocomplete messages from the network, or if you need to perform lengthy calculations.

You can call `setLoadingMessage` multiple times in order to provide an updated message.

#### ParameterValues

```
interface ParameterValues { [key: string]: any}
```

`ParameterValues` is the type used to pass values for parameters into plugins. It's a mapping from parameter keys, which come from the manifest, to the value that the user typed or chose in the autocomplete suggestions. Depending on how your plugin specified the suggestion when calling `set Suggestions` the value will resolve to:

- Suggestion's `data` property if sepecified
- Suggestion's `name` property
- The suggestion itself if a string was passed as the suggestion.
- Query string for freeform parameters
- `undefined` for optional parameters that were skipped.

### figma.textreview

These are methods and properties available on the `figma.textreview` global object. They are responsible for interacting with features relating to text review plugins. For a more information read our in depth guide on text review plugins.

##### `requestToBeEnabledAsync(): Promise<void>`

This method will request your plugin to be enabled as a text review plugin for the user. A modal will pop up that will ask the user if they want to enable the plugin for text review. The promise returned by the function will be resolved if the user accepts in the dialog and will be rejected if the user cancels. Note that to prevent spam the promise will be auto rejected if the user cancels the request multiple times in a given plugin run.

##### `requestToBeDisabledAsync(): Promise<void>`

This method will disable the plugin as a text review plugin if it is enabled. The promise will resolve if it has been successfully been disabled and reject if it wasn’t enabled in the first place.

---

##### isEnabled: boolean [readonly]

This property is a readonly boolean that can be used to check if your plugin is enabled as a text review plugin for the user. It will be true if the plugin is enabled, and false if the plugin is disabled.

### figma.payments

These are all defined on `figma.payments`.

`payments` must be specified in the permissions array in `manifest.json` to access this property.

```
{ "permissions": ["payments"]}
```

If your manifest doesn't contain these fields, the payments API methods described below will throw errors if you try to use them.

##### status: [PaymentStatus](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-payments/#payment-status) [readonly]

An object describing the user’s payment status. Right now, the only attribute on this object is whether the user has paid. In the future, we might add more attributes here to provide more information.

```
type PaymentStatus = { type: "UNPAID" | "PAID" | "NOT_SUPPORTED"}
```

A status type of `NOT_SUPPORTED` indicates that an internal error has occurred and the user's payment status could not be determined at that time. Plugins should treat `NOT_SUPPORTED`as an error and not grant access to paid features.

In development, you’ll be able to test out the entire checkout flow without having to input any actual payment information. Doing so will update your payment status accordingly. Any changes to payment status in development is local and not persisted, and will be reset when restarting your client or using a different machine.

To test out your plugin or widget with payment statuses other than `UNPAID` while developing, use the `set Payment Status In Development` function.

For published resources, this always returns `PAID` for the creator.

---

##### setPaymentStatusInDevelopment(status: [PaymentStatus](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-payments/#payment-status)): void

This method can only be used in development.

This sets your payment status to the value of the `status` argument in this method. This is a global setting that will impact your payment status for all plugins or widgets you run in development.

---

##### getUserFirstRanSecondsAgo(): number

When the plugin was first run by the current user.

This is defined as the number of seconds since the current user ran the plugin or widget for the first time. This will return 0 the very first time a user runs your plugin, and will always return 0 when running a plugin in development.

##### `initiateCheckoutAsync(options?: { interstitial: 'PAID_FEATURE' | 'TRIAL_ENDED' | 'SKIP' }): Promise<void>`

This triggers a checkout flow in the Figma UI for the user to purchase your plugin or widget. The user will be prompted to enter their payment information and purchase your resource. This function resolves either when the user has completed the checkout flow, or they’ve dismissed it.

This function will throw an exception in certain cases:

1. While in query mode and accepting plugin parameters.
2. During widget rendering. Instead, put calls to this function inside your widget event handlers.

See our guide for more information.

This function takes an `options` argument that controls the behavior of the checkout flow.

```
type CheckoutOptions = { // This option controls the behavior and copy of the // interstitial checkout modal. // // * PAID_FEATURE: This is the default. Use this option if // you're asking the user to pay for a // certain premium feature. // // * TRIAL_ENDED: Use this option if the user's free trial // has ended. // // * SKIP: Use this option if you want to skip the // interstitial entirely. This is useful if // you have your own upgrade CTA in your // plugin's UI. interstitial?: "PAID_FEATURE" | "TRIAL_ENDED" | "SKIP"}
```

After `initiateCheckoutAsync` resolves, use `figma.payments.status` to check the user’s payment status.

---

##### requestCheckout(): void

This is useful for text review plugins. Since these plugins can only run in query mode, they cannot call `initiateCheckoutAsync` while a user is editing text as that will throw an exception.

if you are building a text review plugin, call `requestCheckout` to indicate that the user needs to checkout in order to continue using the plugin. When the user exits text editing, they will be prompted to checkout. If the user dismisses the checkout flow, the text review plugin will automatically be disabled.

---

##### `getPluginPaymentTokenAsync(): Promise<string>`

This method generates a token that can be used to securely communicate the identity of the current user on the current plugin or widget. You can provide its returned value as the `plugin_payment_token` query parameter to the payments REST API endpoint.

#### Code Examples

**Limiting free usage of the entire plugin to a number of days**

```
const ONE_DAY_IN_SECONDS = 60 * 60 * 24;const secondsSinceFirstRun = figma.payments.getUserFirstRanSecondsAgo()const daysSinceFirstRun = secondsSinceFirstRun / ONE_DAY_IN_SECONDSasync function checkAndRunPluginFeatureCode() { if (figma.payments.status.type === "UNPAID" && daysSinceFirstRun > 3) { await figma.payments.initiateCheckoutAsync({ interstitial: "TRIAL_ENDED" }) if (figma.payments.status.type === "UNPAID") { figma.notify("Your free trial has expired, please upgrade to continue.") return } } // DO STUFF}
```

**Requiring payment for a feature of the plugin**

```
async function checkAndRunPaidFeatureCode() { if (figma.payments.status.type === "UNPAID") { await figma.payments.initiateCheckoutAsync({ interstitial: "PAID_FEATURE" }) if (figma.payments.status.type === "UNPAID") { figma.notify("Please upgrade to use this feature.") return } } // DO STUFF}
```

**Limiting free usage to a number of runs**

```
async function checkAndRunPluginFeatureCode() { if (figma.payments.status.type === "UNPAID") { const usageCount = await figma.clientStorage.getAsync('usage-count') || 0 if (usageCount >= 10) { await figma.payments.initiateCheckoutAsync({ interstitial: "TRIAL_ENDED" }) if (figma.payments.status.type === "UNPAID") { figma.notify("You have run out of free usages of this plugin.") return } } else { await figma.clientStorage.setAsync('usage-count', usageCount + 1) } } // DO STUFF}
```

#### Parameters

##### categoryInput

The label and color of the annotation category.

### mode

Return the context the plugin is current running in.

- `default` - The plugin is running as a normal plugin.
- `textreview` - The plugin is running to provide text review functionality.
- `inspect` - The plugin is running in the Inspect panel in Dev Mode.
- `codegen` - The plugin is running in the Code section of the Inspect panel in Dev Mode.
- `linkpreview` - The plugin is generating a link preview for a Dev resource in Dev Mode.
- `auth` - The plugin is running to authenticate a user in Dev Mode.

The `linkpreview` and `auth` modes are only available to partner and Figma-owned plugins.

#### Signature

##### [mode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-mode/): 'default' | 'textreview' | 'inspect' | 'codegen' | 'linkpreview' | 'auth' [readonly]

#### Remarks

Here’s a simplified example where you can create an if statement in a plugin that has one set of functionality when it is run in `Dev Mode`, and another set of functionality when run in Figma design:

Code sample to determine editorType and mode

```
if (figma.editorType === "dev") { // Read the document and listen to API events if (figma.mode === "inspect") { // Running in inspect panel mode } else if (figma.mode === "codegen") { // Running in codegen mode }} else if (figma.editorType === "figma") { // If the plugin is run in Figma design, edit the document if (figma.mode === 'textreview') { // Running in text review mode }} else if (figma.editorType === "figjam") { // Do FigJam only operations if (figma.mode === 'textreview') { // Running in text review mode }}
```

### skipInvisibleInstanceChildren

When enabled, causes all node properties and methods to skip over invisible nodes (and their descendants) inside `instances`. This makes operations like document traversal much faster.

Defaults to true in Figma Dev Mode and false in Figma and FigJam

#### Signature

##### [skipInvisibleInstanceChildren](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-skipinvisibleinstancechildren/): boolean

#### Remarks

Accessing and modifying invisible nodes and their descendants inside instances can be slow with the plugin API. This is especially true in large documents with tens of thousands of nodes where a call to `find All` might come across many of these invisible instance children.

If your plugin does not need access to these nodes, we recommend setting `figma.skipInvisibleInstanceChildren = true` as that often makes document traversal significantly faster.

When this flag is enabled, it will not be possible to access invisible nodes (and their descendants) inside instances. This has the following effects:

- `children` and methods such as `find All` will exclude these nodes.
- `figma.get Node By Id Async` will return a promise containing null.
- `figma.get Node By Id` will return null.
- Accessing a property on an existing node object for an invisible node will throw an error.

For example, suppose that a portion of the document tree looks like this:

Frame (visible) → Instance (visible) → Frame (invisible) → Text (visible)

The last two frame and text nodes cannot be accessed after setting `figma.skipInvisibleInstanceChildren = true`.

The benefit of enabling this flag is that document traversal methods, `find All` and `find One`, can be up to several times faster in large documents that have invisible instance children.`find All With Criteria` can be up to hundreds of times faster in large documents.

### closePlugin

Closes the plugin. You should always call this function once your plugin is done running. When called, any UI that's open will be closed and any `setTimeout` or `setInterval` timers will be cancelled.

#### Signature

##### [closePlugin](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-closeplugin/)(message?: string): void

#### Parameters

##### message

Optional -- display a visual bell toast with the message after the plugin closes.

#### Remarks

Calling `figma.closePlugin()` disables callbacks and Figma APIs. It does not, however, abort the plugin. Any lines of Javascript after this call will also run. For example, consider the following plugin that expects the user to have one layer selected:

Simple closePlugin

```
if (figma.currentPage.selection.length !== 1) { figma.closePlugin()}figma.currentPage.selection[0].opacity = 0.5
```

This will not work. The last line will still run, but will throw an exception because access to `figma.currentPage` has been disabled. As such, it is not recommended to run any code after calling `figma.closePlugin()`.

A simple way to easily exit your plugin is to wrap your plugin in a function, instead of running code at the top-level, and always follow `figma.closePlugin()` with a `return` statement:

Early return

```
function main() { if (figma.currentPage.selection.length !== 1) { figma.closePlugin() return } figma.currentPage.selection[0].opacity = 0.5}main()
```

It's good practice to have all input validation done at the start of the plugin. However, there may be cases where the plugin may need to close after a chain of multiple function calls. If you expect to have to close the plugin deep within your code, but don't want to necessarily want the user to see an error, the example above will not be sufficient.

One alternative is to use a top-level try-catch statement. However, you will need to be responsible for making sure that there are no usages of try-catch between the top-level try-catch and the call to `figma.closePlugin()`, or to pass along the close command if necessary. Example:

Top-level try-catch

```
const CLOSE_PLUGIN_MSG = "_CLOSE_PLUGIN_"function someNestedFunctionCallThatClosesThePlugin() { throw CLOSE_PLUGIN_MSG}function main() { someNestedFunctionCallThatClosesThePlugin()}try { main()} catch (e) { if (e === CLOSE_PLUGIN_MSG) { figma.closePlugin() } else { // >> DO NOT LEAVE THIS OUT << // If we caught any other kind of exception, // it's a real error and should be passed along. throw e }}
```
### notify

Shows a notification on the bottom of the screen.

#### Signature

##### [notify](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-notify/)(message: string, options?: [NotificationOptions](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-notify/#notification-options)): [NotificationHandler](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-notify/#notification-handler)

#### Parameters

##### message

The message to show. It is limited to 100 characters. Longer messages will be truncated.

##### options

An optional argument with the following optional parameters:

```
interface NotificationOptions { timeout?: number; error?: boolean; onDequeue?: (reason: NotifyDequeueReason) => void button?: { text: string action: () => boolean | void }}
```

- `timeout`: How long the notification stays up in milliseconds before closing. Defaults to 3 seconds when not specified. Set the timeout to `Infinity` to make the notification show indefinitely until the plugin is closed.
- `error`: If true, display the notification as an error message, with a different color.
- `onDequeue`: A function that will run when the notification is dequeued. This can happen due to the timeout being reached, the notification being dismissed by the user or Figma, or the user clicking the notification's `button`.
- The function is passed a `NotifyDequeueReason`, which is defined as the following:

```
type NotifyDequeueReason = 'timeout' | 'dismiss' | 'action_button_click'
```

- `button`: An object representing an action button that will be added to the notification.
- `text`: The message to display on the action button.
- `action`: The function to execute when the user clicks the button. If this function returns `false`, the message will remain when the button is clicked. Otherwise, clicking the action button dismisses the notify message.

#### Remarks

The `notify` API is a convenient way to show a message to the user. These messages can be queued.

If the message includes a custom action button, it will be closed automatically when the plugin closes.

Calling `figma.notify` returns a `NotificationHandler` object. This object contains a single `handler.cancel()` method that can be used to remove the notification before it times out by itself. This is useful if the notification becomes no longer relevant.

```
interface NotificationHandler { cancel: () => void}
```

An alternative way to show a message to the user is to pass a message to the `figma.close Plugin` function.

### commitUndo

Commits actions to undo history. This does not trigger an undo.

#### Signature

##### [commitUndo](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-commitundo/)(): void

#### Remarks

By default, plugin actions are not committed to undo history. Call `figma.commitUndo()` so that triggered undos can revert a subset of plugin actions.

For example, after running the following plugin code, the first triggered undo will undo both the rectangle and the ellipse:

```
figma.createRectangle();figma.createEllipse();figma.closePlugin();
```

Whereas if we call `commitUndo()` in our plugin, the first triggered undo will only undo the ellipse:

```
figma.createRectangle();figma.commitUndo();figma.createEllipse();figma.closePlugin();
```

### saveVersionHistoryAsync

Saves a new version of the file and adds it to the version history of the file. Returns the new version id.

#### Signature

##### [saveVersionHistoryAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-saveversionhistoryasync/)(title: string, description?: string): Promise<[VersionHistoryResult](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-saveversionhistoryasync/#version-history-result)>

#### Parameters

##### title

The title of the version. This must be a non-empty string.

##### description

An optional argument to describe the version.

Calling `saveVersionHistoryAsync` returns a promise that resolves to `null` or an instance of `VersionHistoryResult`:

```
interface VersionHistoryResult { id: string}
```

- `id`: The version id of this newly saved version.

#### Remarks

It is not guaranteed that all changes made before this method is used will be saved to version history. For example,

Changes may not all be saved

```
async function example() { await figma.createRectangle(); await figma.saveVersionHistoryAsync('v1'); figma.closePlugin();}example().catch((e) => figma.closePluginWithFailure(e))
```

The newly created rectangle may not be included in the v1 version. As a work around, you can wait before calling `saveVersionHistoryAsync()`. For example,

Wait to save

```
async function example() { await figma.createRectangle(); await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000)); // wait for 1 second await figma.saveVersionHistoryAsync('v1'); figma.closePlugin();}
```

Typically, manual changes that precede the execution of `saveVersionHistoryAsync()` will be included. If you want to use `saveVersionHistoryAsync()` before the plugin makes additional changes, make sure to use the method with an async/await or a Promise.

### openExternal

Open a url in a new tab.

#### Signature

##### [openExternal](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-openexternal/)(url: string): void

#### Remarks

In the VS Code Extension, this API is required to open a url in the browser. Read more in Dev Mode plugins in Visual Studio Code.

### showUI

Enables you to render UI to interact with the user, or simply to access browser APIs. This function creates a modal dialog with an `<iframe>` containing the HTML markup in the `html`argument.

#### Signature

##### [showUI](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-showui/)(html: string, options?: [ShowUIOptions](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-showui/#show-uioptions)): void

#### Parameters

##### html

The HTML to insert into the iframe. You can pass in the HTML code as a string here, but this will often be the global value `__html__`.

##### options

An object that may contain the following optional parameters:

- `visible`: Whether the UI starts out displayed to the user. Defaults to `true`. You can use `figma.ui.show()` and `figma.ui.hide()` to change the visibility later.
- `width`: The width of the UI. Defaults to 300. Minimum is 70. Can be changed later using `figma.ui.resize(width, height)`
- `height`: The height of the UI. Defaults to 200. Minimum is 0. Can be changed later using `figma.ui.resize(width, height)`
- `title`: The title of the UI window. Defaults to the plugin name.
- `position`: The position of the UI window. Defaults to the last position of the iframe or the center of the viewport. If specified, expects an X/Y coordinate in the canvas space (i.e matches x/y values returned by `<PluginNode>.x` and `<PluginNode>.y`)
- `themeColors`: Defaults to `false`. When enabled, CSS variables will be added to the plugin iframe to allow support for light and dark themes.

If the position specified is outside of the user's viewport, the iframe will be moved so that it remains in the user's viewport.

#### Remarks

The easiest way to use this API is to load the HTML file defined in the manifest. This enables writing a separate HTML file which can be accessed through the `__html__` global variable.

If the `<iframe>` UI is already showing when this function is called, the previous UI will be closed before the new one is displayed.

#### Usage Examples

Example usage

```
figma.showUI( "<b>Hello from Figma</b>", { width: 400, height: 200, title: "My title" })figma.showUI( "<b>Hello from Figma</b>", { width: 400, height: 200, title: "My title", position: { x: 100, y: 100 } })figma.showUI(__html__)
```

### on

- The selection on the current page changed.
- The current page changed.
- The document has changed.
- An object from outside Figma is dropped onto the canvas

- The plugin closed.
- The plugin has started running.
- The timer has started running.

#### Signature

##### [on](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-on/)(type: [ArgFreeEventType](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-on/#arg-free-event-type), callback: () => void): void

##### [on](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-on/)(type: 'run', callback: (event: [RunEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/RunEvent/)) => void): void

##### [on](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-on/)(type: 'drop', callback: (event: [DropEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/DropEvent/)) => boolean): void

##### [on](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-on/)(type: 'documentchange', callback: (event: [DocumentChangeEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/DocumentChangeEvent/)) => void): void

##### [on](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-on/)(type: 'canvasviewchange', callback: (event: [CanvasViewChangeEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CanvasViewChangeEvent/)) => void): void

##### [on](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-on/)(type: 'textreview', callback: (event: [TextReviewEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/TextReviewEvent/)) => Promise<[TextReviewRange](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/TextReviewRange/)[]> | [TextReviewRange](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/TextReviewRange/)[]): void

##### [on](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-on/)(type: 'stylechange', callback: (event: [StyleChangeEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/StyleChangeEvent/)) => void): void

#### Parameters

##### type

A string identifying the type of event that the callback will be called on.

This is either an `ArgFreeEventType`, `run`, `drop`, or `documentchange`. The `run` event callback will be passed a `RunEvent`. The `drop` event callback will be passed a `DropEvent`. The `documentchange` event callback will be passed a `DocumentChangeEvent`.

```
type ArgFreeEventType = "selectionchange" | "currentpagechange" | "close" | "timerstart" | "timerstop" | "timerpause" | "timerresume" | "timeradjust" | "timerdone"
```

##### callback

A function that will be called when the event happens. If `type` is 'run', then this function will be passed a `RunEvent`. If `type` is 'drop', then this function will be passed a `DropEvent`. If `type` is 'documentchange', then this function will be passed a `DocumentChangeEvent`.

Otherwise nothing will be passed in.

#### Remarks

This API tries to match Node.js conventions around similar `.on` APIs.

It's important to understand that the `.on` API runs the callbacks **asynchronously**. For example:

```
figma.on("selectionchange", () => { console.log("changed") })console.log("before")figma.currentPage.selection = []console.log("after")// Output:// "before"// "after"// "changed"
```

The asynchronous nature of these APIs have a few other implications.

The callback will not necessarily be called each time the event happens. For example, this will only trigger the event once:

```
figma.currentPage.selection = [figma.createRectangle()]figma.currentPage.selection = [figma.createFrame()]
```

Nor will the ordering of the event trigger and event registration affect whether the callback is called.

```
figma.currentPage.selection = [figma.createFrame()]figma.on("selectionchange", () => { "this will get called!" })
```

#### Available event types

##### `"currentpagechange"`

This event will trigger when the user navigates to a different page, or when the plugin changes the value of `figma.currentPage`.

##### `"selectionchange"`

This event will trigger when the selection of the **current page** changes. This can happen:

- By user action.
- Due to plugin code.
- When the current page changes (a `"currentpagechange"` event always triggers a `"selectionchange"` event).
- When a selected node is deleted.
- When a selected node becomes the child of another selected node (in which case it is considered indirectly selected, and is no longer in `figma.currentPage.selection`)

Note also that changing the selection via the plugin API, then changing it back to its previous value immediately still triggers the event.

##### `"documentchange"`

If the plugin manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, you must first call `figma.load All Pages Async` to access this event. Because this may introduce a loading delay, consider using more granular alternatives, such as the `"stylechange"` event, or using `Page Node.on` with the `"nodechange"` event.

This event will trigger when a change is made to the currently open file. The event will be called when nodes/styles are either added, removed, or changed in a document.

The callback will be passed with a DocumentChangeEvent with the below interface:

```
interface DocumentChangeEvent { documentChanges: DocumentChange[]}
```

Note that `DocumentChangeEvent` has a `documentChanges` property with an array of `DocumentChange`s. Figma will not call the 'documentchange' callback synchronously and will instead batch the updates and send them to the callback periodically.

There are 6 different `Document Change` types that we currently notify on and we might add more in the future. Each of these changes has a `type` property to distinguish them:

|Change|`type` property|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`Create Change`|`'CREATE'`|A node has been created in the document. If a node with nested children is being added to the document a `CreateChange` will only be made for the highest level parent that was added to the document.|
|`Delete Change`|`'DELETE'`|A node has been removed from the document. If a node with nested children is being removed from the document a `DeleteChange` will only be made for the highest level parent that was removed from the document.|
|`Property Change`|`'PROPERTY_CHANGE'`|A property of a node has changed.|
|`Style Create Change`|`'STYLE_CREATE'`|A style has been added to the document.|
|`Style Delete Change`|`'STYLE_DELETE'`|A style has been removed from the document.|
|`Style Property Change`|`'STYLE_PROPERTY_CHANGE'`|A style has had a property changed.|

###### Special cases

We currently never notify a `'documentchange'` listener in the following scenarios:

- if the change was caused directly by your plugin in a `documentchange` callback
- if an instance sublayer was updated by a change to a main component
- if a node was updated as a result of a style changing

###### Example

Here is an example of exhaustively checking changes to the document and logging them to the console.

```
figma.on("documentchange", (event) => {for (const change of event.documentChanges) { switch (change.type) { case "CREATE": console.log( `Node ${change.id} created by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user` ); break; case "DELETE": console.log( `Node ${change.id} deleted by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user` ); break; case "PROPERTY_CHANGE": for (const prop of change.properties) { console.log( `Node ${ change.id } had ${prop} changed by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user` ); } break; case "STYLE_CREATE": console.log( `Style ${change.id} created by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user` ); break; case "STYLE_DELETE": console.log( `Style ${change.id} deleted by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user` ); break; case "STYLE_PROPERTY_CHANGE": for (const prop of change.properties) { console.log( `Style ${ change.id } had ${prop} changed by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user` ); } break; } }});
```

For a more involved example see our plugin samples on Git Hub.

##### `"textreview"`

This event is only available to plugins that have the `"textreview"` capability in their `manifest.json` and the plugin is running in text review mode.

`"textreview"` events allow plugins to review text in a document and act as either a replacement or a supplement to native spell check.

This event is triggered periodically when the user is typing in a text node. The callback will be passed with a TextReviewEvent with the below interface:

```
interface TextReviewEvent { text: string}
```

The `text` property is the text that the user has currently typed into the node.

A `"textreview"` event listener should return a promise that resolves to an array of `TextReviewRange` objects. Each `TextReviewRange` object represents a single range of text that should be marked as either an error or a suggestion. The `TextReviewRange` interface is defined as:

```
type TextReviewRange = { start: number end: number suggestions: string[] color?: 'RED' | 'GREEN' | 'BLUE'}
```

The `start` property is the index of the first character in the range. The `end` property is the index of the last character in the range. The `suggestions` property is an array of strings that represent the suggestions for the range. The `color` property is optional and can be used to change the color of the underline that is drawn under the range. If no color is specified the underline will be red.

For more information read our in depth guide on text review plugins.

##### `"drop"`

This event will trigger when objects outside Figma (such as elements from other browser windows, or files from the local filesystem) are dropped onto the canvas.

It can also be triggered by a special `pluginDrop` message sent from the UI. See the Triggering drop events from the UI section for more details.

The callback will be passed a `DropEvent` with the below interface. It should return `false` if it wants to handle the particular drop and stop Figma from performing the default drop behavior.

```
interface DropEvent { node: BaseNode | SceneNode x: number y: number absoluteX: number absoluteY: number items: DropItem[] files: DropFile[] dropMetadata?: any}
```

- The `node` property contains the node where the drop landed. This will sometimes be the page node if the drop didn't land on anything in the canvas, or if target node is locked or cannot be a parent of another node.
- The `x` and `y` properties are coordinates relative to the node drop target
- The `absoluteX` and `absoluteY` properties are absolute canvas coordinates
- The `items` property is an array of `DropItem` objects. You will see multiple objects if a drop contains multiple, non-file data types. If there are no data items, this array will be empty.
- The `files` property is an array of dropped files represented as `DropFile` objects. If no files are present, this array will be empty.
- The `dropMetadata` property comes from drop events explicitly triggered by the UI.

Items and files will conform to the below interfaces:

```
interface DropItem { type: string // e.g. "text/html", "text/uri-list", etc... data: string}interface DropFile { name: string // file name type: string // e.g. "image/png" getBytesAsync(): Promise<Uint8Array> // get raw file bytes getTextAsync(): Promise<string> // get text assuming file is UTF8-encoded}
```

See the Icon Drag-and-Drop and PNG Crop examples in the figma/plugin-samples repository for plugins that implement this API.

###### UI Recommendations

When the plugin registers a drop callback, it should give the user instructions with either text in the plugin UI or `figma.notify()` (if the plugin does not show a UI) telling them what to do.

`figma.notify()` can be called with the `timeout` option set to `Infinity` to make the notification show for as long as the plugin is open.

##### `"close"`

This event will trigger when the plugin is about to close, either from a call to `figma.closePlugin()` or the user closing the plugin via the UI.

This is a good place to run cleanup actions. For example, some plugins add UI elements in the canvas by creating nodes. These UI elements should be deleted when the plugin is closed. Note that you don't need to call `figma.closePlugin()` again in this function.

**You should use this API only if strictly necessary, and run as little code as possible in the callback when doing so**. When a user closes a plugin, they expect it to be closed immediately. Having long-running actions in the closing callback prevents the plugin for closing promptly.

This is also not the place to run any asynchronous actions (e.g. register callbacks, using `await`, etc). The plugin execution environment will be destroyed immediately when all the callbacks have returned, and further callbacks will not be called.

##### `"run"`

This event is triggered when a plugin is run. For plugins with parameters, this happens after all parameters have been enter by the user in the quick action UI. For all other plugins this happens immediately after launch.

The callback will be passed a `RunEvent` that looks like:

```
interface RunEvent { parameters?: ParameterValues command: string}
```

- The `parameters` property is of type `Parameter Values`, and contains the value entered for each parameter.
- The `command` argument is the same as `figma.command`, but provided here again for convenience.

Handling the `run` event is only required for plugins with parameters. For all plugins it can still be a convenient spot to put your top level code, since it is called on every plugin run.

##### `"stylechange"`

Triggered when any styles in the document change.

The callback will receive a StyleChangeEvent with the below interface:

```
interface StyleChangeEvent { styleChanges: StyleChange[]}
```

There are 3 different `Style Change` types. Each of these changes has a `type` property to distinguish them:

|Change|`type` property|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`Style Create Change`|`'STYLE_CREATE'`|A style has been added to the document.|
|`Style Delete Change`|`'STYLE_DELETE'`|A style has been removed from the document.|
|`Style Property Change`|`'STYLE_PROPERTY_CHANGE'`|A style has had a property changed.|

##### `"timerstart"`

This event will trigger when somebody starts a timer in the document. This can happen either by a user (either the current user or a multiplayer user) starting the timer from the UI, or triggered by plugin code. To inspect the current state of the timer when this event fires, use the `figma.timer` interface. For example:

```
figma.on("timerstart", () => console.log(figma.timer.remaining))figma.timer.start(300)// Output:// 300
```

##### `"timerpause"`

Triggered when a timer that is running is paused.

##### `"timerstop"`

Triggered when the timer is stopped.

##### `"timerdone"`

Triggered when the timer is running and reaches 0 time remaining.

##### `"timerresume"`

Triggered when a timer that is paused is resumed.

##### `"timeradjust"`

Triggered when the total time on the timer changes. From the UI, it is only possible to add time to the timer. However, plugin code can both add and remove time from a running timer.

### off

Removes a callback added with `figma.on` or `figma.once`.

#### Signature

##### [off](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-off/)(type: [ArgFreeEventType](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-on/#arg-free-event-type), callback: () => void): void

##### [off](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-off/)(type: 'run', callback: (event: [RunEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/RunEvent/)) => void): void

##### [off](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-off/)(type: 'drop', callback: (event: [DropEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/DropEvent/)) => boolean): void

##### [off](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-off/)(type: 'documentchange', callback: (event: [DocumentChangeEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/DocumentChangeEvent/)) => void): void

##### [off](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-off/)(type: 'slidesviewchange', callback: (event: [SlidesViewChangeEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/SlidesViewChangeEvent/)) => void): void

##### [off](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-off/)(type: 'canvasviewchange', callback: (event: [CanvasViewChangeEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CanvasViewChangeEvent/)) => void): void

##### [off](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-off/)(type: 'textreview', callback: (event: [TextReviewEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/TextReviewEvent/)) => Promise<[TextReviewRange](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/TextReviewRange/)[]> | [TextReviewRange](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/TextReviewRange/)[]): void

##### [off](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-off/)(type: 'stylechange', callback: (event: [StyleChangeEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/StyleChangeEvent/)) => void): void

#### Remarks

The callback needs to be the same object that was originally added. For example, you can do this:

Correct way to remove a callback

```
let fn = () => { console.log("selectionchanged") }figma.on("selectionchange", fn)figma.off("selectionchange", fn)
```

whereas the following won't work, because the function objects are different:

Incorrect way to remove a callback

```
figma.on("selectionchange", () => { console.log("selectionchanged") })figma.off("selectionchange", () => { console.log("selectionchanged") })
```

### mixed

This a constant value that some node properties return when they are a mix of multiple values. An example might be font size: a single text node can use multiple different font sizes for different character ranges. For those properties, you should always compare against `figma.mixed`.

#### Signature

##### [mixed](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-mixed/): unique symbol [readonly]

#### Remarks

Example:

Check if property is a mix of multiple values

```
if (node.type === 'RECTANGLE') { if (node.cornerRadius !== figma.mixed) { console.log(`Single corner radius: ${node.cornerRadius}`) } else { console.log(`Mixed corner radius: ${node.topLeftRadius}, ${node.topRightRadius}, ${node.bottomLeftRadius}, ${node.bottomRightRadius}`) }}
```

Your plugin never needs to know what the actual value of `figma.mixed` is, only that it is a unique, constant value that can be compared against. That being said, this value returns an object of type `symbol` which is a more advanced feature of Javascript. Read more about symbols. It works in TypeScript via the `unique symbol` subtype.

### createRectangle

#### Parameters

##### dividerName

An optional argument to specify the name of the page divider node. It won't change how the page divider appears in the UI, but it specifies the name of the underlying node. The dividerName must be a page divider name (all asterisks, all en dashes, all em dashes, or all spaces). If no dividerName is specified, the default name for the created page divider node is "---".

#### Remarks

A page divider is always the child of the document node and cannot have any children.

### createSlice

```

### createNodeFromJSXAsync

This API creates a new node using the JSX API used by widgets.

#### Signature

##### [createNodeFromJSXAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-createnodefromjsxasync/)(jsx: any): Promise<[SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)>

#### Remarks

This API is a convenient and ergonomic way to bulk create nodes:

```
const {Image, AutoLayout} = figma.widget;const node = await figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync( <AutoLayout fill="#F00" padding={20}> <Image src="https://picsum.photos/200" width={200} height={200}/> </AutoLayout>)
```

The JSX API does not support all features that exist on the equivalent SceneNode. For example we don't support setting style ids or rendering instances via JSX. You can always use `createNodeFromJSXAsync` to create a node and then set the properties you need on the created nodes.

Note that to use this API you must configure your build system to compile tsx.

There are 3 steps that you need to do to use this API in your plugin.

1. Install the `@figma/widget-typings` package.
2. Add the appropriate compiler options to your `tsconfig.json` file
3. Make sure that the file name for you code ends with the `.tsx` extension

If you are building a widget these should already be done for you.

##### Install the widget typings

In the directory of your plugin run the following command to install the widget typings:

```
npm i --save-dev @figma/widget-typings
```

##### Add compiler options to your `tsconfig.json` file

You need to make sure that you add the following properties to your `tsconfig.json` file. This configures typescript to transpile any jsx that you use into a way that our plugin runtime understands.

```
"jsx": "react","jsxFactory": "figma.widget.h","jsxFragmentFactory": "figma.widget.Fragment",
```

Here is an example completed `tsconfig.json` file with the appropriate properties added.

```
{ "compilerOptions": { "jsx": "react", "jsxFactory": "figma.widget.h", "jsxFragmentFactory": "figma.widget.Fragment", "target": "es6", "lib": [ "es6" ], "strict": true, "typeRoots": [ "./node_modules/@types", "./node_modules/@figma" ] }}
```

If you are using a build system (ex babel, vite, esbuild). You might have to configure the jsx options for your build system.

##### Change file extension

For plugins our default template puts your code in a `code.ts` file. You should rename this to `code.tsx` so that you can use jsx in your plugin.

### createBooleanOperation

**DEPRECATED:** Use `figma.union`, `figma.subtract`, `figma.intersect`, `figma.exclude`instead.

#### Signature

##### [createBooleanOperation](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-createbooleanoperation/)(): [BooleanOperationNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/BooleanOperationNode/)

#### Remarks

Using this function is not recommended because empty boolean operation nodes can have surprising, unpredictable behavior. It will eventually be remove. Use one of the functions listed above instead.

Creates a new, empty boolean operation node. The particular kind of operation is set via `.booleanOperation`. By default, the value is `"UNION"`.

This snippet, for example, creates a boolean operation node that is a union of a rectangle and an ellipse.

Create a boolean operation node

```
const node = figma.createBooleanOperation()node.appendChild(figma.createRectangle())node.appendChild(figma.createEllipse())
```


### loadFontAsync

Makes a font available _in the plugin_ for use when creating and modifying text. Calling this function is **necessary** to modify any property of a text node that may cause the rendered text to change, including `.characters`, `.fontSize`, `.fontName`, etc.

You can either pass in a hardcoded font, a font loaded via `listAvailableFontsAsync`, or the font stored on an existing text node.

Read more about how to work with fonts, when to load them, and how to load them in the Working with Text page.

#### Signature

##### `[loadFontAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-loadfontasync/)(fontName: [FontName](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/FontName/)): Promise<void>`

#### Remarks

This function only works to load fonts _already accessible in the Figma editor_ available to _plugins_. It does not load fonts from the internet.

Tip: to load multiple fonts at the same time, you may find Promise.all helpful.

A common question is whether a plugin needs to be careful about calling `loadFontAsync(font)` for the same font multiple times. The answer is somewhat nuanced. The result of loading a font is cached, so calling `loadFontAsync` won't re-fetch the same font from disk. Therefore, calling `loadFontAsync` on every frame would be perfectly ok.

However, note that `loadFontAsync` returns a Promise. Even a Promise resolves immediately, it still needs to round-trip to the JavaScript event loop. So you probably shouldn't call `loadFontAsync` on the same font repeatedly inside a loop.

### createImage

Creates an `Image` object from the raw bytes of a file content. Note that `Image` objects **are not nodes**. They are handles to images stored by Figma. Frame backgrounds, or fills of shapes (e.g. a rectangle) may contain images. Example: how to work with images.

#### Signature

##### [createImage](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-createimage/)(data: Uint8Array): [Image](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Image/)

#### Remarks

The `data` passed in must be encoded as a PNG, JPEG, or GIF. Images have a maximum size of 4096 pixels (4K) in width and height. Invalid images will throw an error.

#### Possible error cases

`Image is too small`

`Image is too large`

`Image type is unsupported`


### createImageAsync

Creates an `Image` object from a src URL. Note that `Image` objects **are not nodes**. They are handles to images stored by Figma. Frame backgrounds, or fills of shapes (e.g. a rectangle) may contain images.

#### Signature

##### [createImageAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-createimageasync/)(src: string): Promise<[Image](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Image/)>

#### Remarks

The `src` passed in must be a URL to a PNG, JPEG, or GIF. Images have a maximum size of 4096 pixels (4K) in width and height. Invalid images will reject and log the reason in the console.

Example usage of createImageAsync

```
figma.createImageAsync( 'https://picsum.photos/200' ).then(async (image: Image) => { // Create node const node = figma.createRectangle() // Resize the node to match the image's width and height const { width, height } = await image.getSizeAsync() node.resize(width, height) // Set the fill on the node node.fills = [ { type: 'IMAGE', imageHash: image.hash, scaleMode: 'FILL' } ] figma.closePlugin() }).catch((error: any) => { console.log(error) figma.closePlugin() })
```

#### Possible error cases

`Image is too small`

`Image is too large`

`Image type is unsupported`


### createVideoAsync

Creates a `Video` object from the raw bytes of a file content. Like `Image` objects, `Video`objects **are not nodes**. They are handles to images stored by Figma. Frame backgrounds, or fills of shapes (e.g. a rectangle) may contain videos.

#### Signature

##### [createVideoAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-createvideoasync/)(data: Uint8Array): Promise<[Video](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Video/)>

#### Remarks

The `data` passed in must be encoded as a .MP4, .MOV, or .WebM. Videos have a maximum size of 100MB. Invalid videos will throw an error.

Video can only be added to files in a paid Education, Professional, and Organization team. Plugins running on files in free Starter teams can edit existing video in a file but not upload video to it.

#### Possible error cases

`Uploading videos only works in files in paid Pro teams`

`Video file type must be MP4`

`Video file must be less than 100MB`

### createLinkPreviewAsync

This API is only available in FigJam.

Resolves link metadata from a URL, and inserts either an embed or a unfurled preview of the link into the document An embed will be inserted if the URL is a valid OEmbed provider (has a `<link type="application/json+oembed" ... />` tag). The returned `<iframe>` source will be converted into an EmbedNode.

Otherwise, the title, description, thumbnail, and favicon will be parsed from the HTML markup of the URL using standard `og` or `twitter` meta tags. This information will be converted into a LinkUnfurlNode.

#### Signature

##### [createLinkPreviewAsync](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-createlinkpreviewasync/)(url: string): Promise<[EmbedNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/EmbedNode/) | [LinkUnfurlNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/LinkUnfurlNode/)>

#### Parameters

##### url

#### Remarks

This API is only available in FigJam

Creating embeds and link unfurl nodes

```
(async () => { // Creates an EmbedNode const youtubeEmbed = await figma.createLinkPreviewAsync('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9RHt2OyuY') // Creates a LinkUnfurlNode const unfurledLink = await figma.createLinkPreviewAsync('https://www.figma.com/community/plugins')})()
```

### createGif

This API is only available in FigJam

Creates a new GIF with the given `Image` hash.

#### Signature

##### [createGif](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-creategif/)(hash: string): [MediaNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/MediaNode/)

#### Parameters

##### hash

#### Remarks

This API is only available in FigJam

### combineAsVariants

This API is only available in Figma Design

Creates a new `Component Set Node` by combining all the nodes in `nodes`, which should all have type `Component Node`.

#### Signature

##### [combineAsVariants](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-combineasvariants/)(nodes: ReadonlyArray<[ComponentNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/ComponentNode/)>, parent: [BaseNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#base-node) & [ChildrenMixin](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/node-properties/#children-mixin), index?: number): [ComponentSetNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/ComponentSetNode/)

#### Parameters

##### nodes

The list of nodes in the new component set. This list must be non-empty, and must consist of only component nodes.

##### parent

The node under which the new component set will be created. This is similar to `parent.appendChild(componentSet)`, but must be specified at the time that the group is created rather than later.

##### index

An optional index argument that specifies where inside `parent` the new component set will be created. When this argument is not provided, it will default to appending the component set as the last (topmost) child. This is similar to the index argument in `parent.insertChild(index, componentSet)`.

#### Remarks

This API is roughly the equivalent of pressing the "Combine as Variants" button in the editor, but combines the specified list of nodes rather than the current selection. You may still, of course, combine the current selection as variants by passing it as an argument:

Combining variants

```
figma.combineAsVariants(figma.currentPage.selection, parent)
```

Why is there no `figma.createComponentSet()` function? It would create an empty component set, and empty component sets are not supported in Figma.

Since combining as variants involves moving nodes to a different parent, this operation is subject to many reparenting restrictions:

#### Possible error cases

`First argument must be an array of at least one node`

`Cannot insert node at index greater than the number of existing siblings`

`Grouped nodes must be in the same page as the parent`

`Cannot move node. Node is the scene root, which cannot be reparented`

`Cannot move node. Doing so would create a parenting cycle`

`Cannot move node. The root node cannot have children of type other than PAGE`

`Cannot move node. Nodes other than the root node cannot have children of type PAGE`

`Cannot move node. New parent is of a type that cannot have children`

`Cannot move node. New parent is a internal, readonly-only node`

`Cannot move node. Node is an internal, readonly-only node`

`Cannot move node. New parent is an instance or is inside of an instance`

`Cannot move node. Node is inside of an instance`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component cycle`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component inside a component`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component set cycle`

`Cannot move node. A COMPONENT_SET node cannot have children of type other than COMPONENT`

`Cannot move node. PageDivider cannot have children`

### group

Creates new group containing all the nodes in `nodes`. There is no `createGroup` function -- use this instead. Group nodes have many quirks, like auto-resizing, that you can read about in the `Frame Node` section.

#### Signature

##### [group](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-group/)(nodes: ReadonlyArray<[BaseNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#base-node)>, parent: [BaseNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#base-node) & [ChildrenMixin](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/node-properties/#children-mixin), index?: number): [GroupNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/GroupNode/)

#### Parameters

##### nodes

The list of nodes in the new group. This list must be non-empty as Figma does not support empty groups. This list cannot include any node that cannot be reparented, such as children of instances.

##### parent

The node under which the new group will be created. This is similar to `parent.appendChild(group)`, but must be specified at the time that the group is created rather than later.

##### index

An optional index argument that specifies where inside `parent` the new group will be created. When this argument is not provided, it will default to appending the group as the last (topmost) child. This is similar to the index argument in `parent.insertChild(index, group)`.

#### Remarks

This API is roughly the equivalent of pressing Ctrl-G/⌘G in the editor, but groups the specified list of nodes rather than the current selection. You may still, of course, group the current selection by passing it as an argument:

Group nodes

```
figma.group(figma.currentPage.selection, parent)
```

Why is there no `figma.createGroup()` function? It would create an empty group, and empty groups are not supported in Figma.

Why do we require `figma.group(...)` to specify the parent, rather let you call `parent.appendChild(group)` separately? It allows you to create the new group while keeping all the grouped layers in the same absolute x/y locations. The method `.appendChild` preserves the _relative_ position of a node, so if you use `.appendChild`to populate a group, you would need to do additional work to put them back in their original location if that was the desired behavior.

Since grouping involves moving nodes to a different parent, this operation is subject to many reparenting restrictions:

#### Possible error cases

`First argument must be an array of at least one node`

`Cannot insert node at index greater than the number of existing siblings`

`Grouped nodes must be in the same page as the parent`

`Cannot move node. Node is the scene root, which cannot be reparented`

`Cannot move node. Doing so would create a parenting cycle`

`Cannot move node. The root node cannot have children of type other than PAGE`

`Cannot move node. Nodes other than the root node cannot have children of type PAGE`

`Cannot move node. New parent is of a type that cannot have children`

`Cannot move node. New parent is a internal, readonly-only node`

`Cannot move node. Node is an internal, readonly-only node`

`Cannot move node. New parent is an instance or is inside of an instance`

`Cannot move node. Node is inside of an instance`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component cycle`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component inside a component`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component set cycle`

`Cannot move node. A COMPONENT_SET node cannot have children of type other than COMPONENT`

`Cannot move node. PageDivider cannot have children`

### flatten

Flattens every node in nodes into a new vector network.

#### Signature

##### [flatten](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-flatten/)(nodes: ReadonlyArray<[BaseNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#base-node)>, parent?: [BaseNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#base-node) & [ChildrenMixin](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/node-properties/#children-mixin), index?: number): [VectorNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/VectorNode/)

#### Parameters

##### nodes

The list of nodes in the new group. This list must be non-empty and cannot include any node that cannot be reparented, such as children of instances. Make a copy of those nodes first if necessary.

##### parent

The node under which the new vector will be created. This is similar to `parent.appendChild(group)` and defaults to `figma.currentPage` if left unspecified.

##### index

An optional index argument that specifies where inside `parent` the new vector will be created. When this argument is not provided, it will default to appending the vector as the last (topmost) child. This is similar to the index argument in `parent.insertChild(index, group)`.

#### Remarks

This API is roughly the equivalent of pressing Ctrl-E/⌘E in the editor, but flattens the specified list of nodes rather than the current selection. You may still, of course, flatten the current selection by passing it as an argument:

Flatten nodes

```
figma.flatten(figma.currentPage.selection, parent)
```

Since flattening involves moving nodes to a different parent, this operation is subject to many reparenting restrictions:

#### Possible error cases

`First argument must be an array of at least one node`

`Cannot insert node at index greater than the number of existing siblings`

`Grouped nodes must be in the same page as the parent`

`Cannot move node. Node is the scene root, which cannot be reparented`

`Cannot move node. Doing so would create a parenting cycle`

`Cannot move node. The root node cannot have children of type other than PAGE`

`Cannot move node. Nodes other than the root node cannot have children of type PAGE`

`Cannot move node. New parent is of a type that cannot have children`

`Cannot move node. New parent is a internal, readonly-only node`

`Cannot move node. Node is an internal, readonly-only node`

`Cannot move node. New parent is an instance or is inside of an instance`

`Cannot move node. Node is inside of an instance`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component cycle`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component inside a component`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component set cycle`

`Cannot move node. A COMPONENT_SET node cannot have children of type other than COMPONENT`

`Cannot move node. PageDivider cannot have children`

### ungroup

Ungroups the given `node`, moving all of `node`'s children into `node`'s parent and removing `node`. Returns an array of nodes that were children of `node`.

#### Signature

##### [ungroup](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-ungroup/)(node: [SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node) & [ChildrenMixin](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/node-properties/#children-mixin)): Array<[SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)>

#### Parameters

##### node

The node to ungroup.

#### Remarks

This API is roughly the equivalent of pressing Ctrl-Shift-G/⌘⇧G in the editor, but ungroups the given node rather than all nodes in the current selection.

If the ungrouped node is part of the current selection, the ungrouped node's children will become part of the selection. Otherwise the selection is unchanged.

#### Possible error cases

`Instances cannot be ungrouped`

`Components cannot be ungrouped`

`Only group-like nodes can be ungrouped`

`The given node cannot be ungrouped`

### getSlideGrid

**DEPRECATED:** Use `figma.get Canvas Grid` instead.

This API is only available in Figma Slides

#### Signature

##### [getSlideGrid](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-getslidegrid/)(): Array<Array<[SlideNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/SlideNode/)>>

#### Remarks

The slide grid provides structure to both single slide view and grid view. The order of Slides within a presentation is a key part of updating and editing a deck. To visualize the slide nodes in a 2D array, you can call this function.

```
const grid = figma.getSlideGrid()
```

The returned grid is a 2D array of SlideNodes. For example:

```
[ [SlideNode, SlideNode], [SlideNode, SlideNode, SlideNode, SlideNode, SlideNode], [SlideNode, SlideNode, SlideNode, SlideNode, SlideNode], [SlideNode, SlideNode, SlideNode],]
```


### setSlideGrid

**DEPRECATED:** Use `figma.set Canvas Grid` instead.

This API is only available in Figma Slides

#### Signature

##### [setSlideGrid](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-setslidegrid/)(slideGrid: Array<Array<[SlideNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/SlideNode/)>>): void

#### Remarks

The order of Slides within a presentation is a key part of updating and editing a deck. Using this method you can manipulate and reorder the grid.

For example:

```
const grid = figma.getSlideGrid()const [firstRow, ...rest] = grid// move the first row to the endfigma.setSlideGrid([...rest, firstRow])
```

So long as all the Slides in the current grid are passed back to `setSlideGrid` the update will succeed. Meaning, you can change the amount of rows as you please - flatten all to one row, explode to many rows, etc, and the method will handle all updates for you.

### getCanvasGrid

Gets the current canvas grid layout as a 2D array of nodes.

This API is only available in Figma Slides and Figma Buzz

#### Signature

##### [getCanvasGrid](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-getcanvasgrid/)(): Array<Array<[SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)>>

#### Remarks

The canvas grid represents the organizational structure of assets in Slides and Buzz, where each position can contain a node (slide or asset).

To visualize the nodes in the canvas grid in a 2D array, you can call this function.

```
const grid = figma.getCanvasGrid()
```


### setCanvasGrid

Sets the canvas grid layout, reorganizing nodes in the canvas.

This API is only available in Figma Slides and Figma Buzz

#### Signature

##### [setCanvasGrid](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-setcanvasgrid/)(canvasGrid: Array<Array<[SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)>>): void

#### Parameters

##### canvasGrid

A 2D array representing the new canvas grid layout

#### Remarks

This allows you to programmatically rearrange the layout of slides or assets in the canvas grid. All nodes in the current grid must be included in the new layout.

For example:

```
const grid = figma.getCanvasGrid()const [firstRow, ...rest] = grid// move the first row to the endfigma.setCanvasGrid([...rest, firstRow])
```


### createCanvasRow

Creates a new row in the canvas grid at the specified index.

This API is only available in Figma Slides and Figma Buzz

#### Signature

##### [createCanvasRow](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-createcanvasrow/)(rowIndex?: number): [SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)

#### Parameters

##### rowIndex

The index where to insert the new row (optional)

#### Remarks

If no row index is provided, the row will be added at the end of the grid.

### moveNodesToCoord

Moves the specified nodes to a specific coordinate in the canvas grid.

This API is only available in Figma Slides and Figma Buzz

This function allows precise positioning of multiple nodes within the canvas grid system used in Slides and Buzz.

#### Signature

##### [moveNodesToCoord](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-movenodestocoord/)(nodeIds: string[], rowIndex?: number, columnIndex?: number): void

#### Parameters

##### nodeIds

Array of node IDs to move

##### rowIndex

The target row index in the canvas grid (optional)

##### columnIndex

The target column index in the canvas grid (optional)

#### Remarks

Calling this function without rowIndex and columnIndex will move the node to the end of the grid

### fetch

Fetch a resource from the network, and return a promise with the response.

#### Signature

##### [fetch](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/global-fetch/)(url: string, init?: [FetchOptions](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/global-fetch/#fetch-options)): Promise<[FetchResponse](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/global-fetch/#fetch-response)>

#### Parameters

##### url

The URL of the requested resource. Unlike standardized `fetch`, this must be a `string`.

##### init

An optional argument with the following optional parameters:

```
interface FetchOptions { method?: string headers?: {[name: string]: string} body?: Uint8Array | string credentials?: string cache?: string redirect?: string referrer?: string integrity?: string}
```

- `method`: The request method, e.g. `GET`, `POST`, etc.
- `headers`: The headers to add to the request. Note that unlike the standardized `fetch`, this can only be a plain javascript object.
- `body`: The body to add to this request, if any. This can be either a string or a Uint8Array.
- `cache`: The cache mode to use for this request. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/cache for available values.
- `redirect`: The redirect mode to use for this request: `follow` or `error`.
- `referrer`: The referrer for this request.
- `integrity`: The subresource integrity value of the request. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity for more information.

Calling fetch returns a `FetchResponse` object:

```
interface FetchResponse { headersObject: {[name: string]: string} ok: boolean redirected: boolean status: number statusText: string type: string url: string arrayBuffer(): Promise<ArrayBuffer> text(): Promise<string> json(): Promise<any>}
```

- `headersObject`: The headers associated with the response. Note that unlike the standardized `fetch`, this is a plain object.
- `ok`: Whether the result was successful.
- `redirected`: Whether the response is the result of a redirect.
- `status`: The status code of the response.
- `statusText`: The status text corresponding to this status code.
- `type`: The type of response.
- `url`: The URL of the response.
- `arrayBuffer()`: Returns a promise with the contents of the response body as a `ArrayBuffer`.
- `text()`: Returns a promise with the contents of the response body as a string, decoded as `utf-8`.
- `json()`: Returns a promise with the contents of the response body as Javascript object.

#### Remarks

This function has similar behavior to the standardized `fetch()` function, with some minor differences. See the `Fetch Options` and `Fetch Response` interfaces for more information.


## Node Types

In Figma, the Node is the basis for representing layers. There are many different types of nodes, each with their own set of properties.

- `Boolean Operation Node`
- `Code Block Node`
- `Component Node`
- `Component Set Node`
- `Connector Node`
- `Document Node`
- `Ellipse Node`
- `Embed Node`
- `Frame Node`
- `Group Node`
- `Highlight Node`
- `Instance Node`
- `Interactive Slide Element Node`
- `Line Node`
- `Link Unfurl Node`
- `Media Node`
- `Page Node`
- `Polygon Node`
- `Rectangle Node`
- `Removed Node`
- `Section Node`
- `Shape With Text Node`
- `Slice Node`
- `Slide Grid Node`
- `Slide Node`
- `Slide Row Node`
- `Stamp Node`
- `Star Node`
- `Sticky Node`
- `Table Cell Node`
- `Table Node`
- `Text Node`
- `Text Path Node`
- `Transform Group Node`
- `Vector Node`
- `Washi Tape Node`
- `Widget Node`

In the Typings File, each node type is represented with an interface. The most general `BaseNode` is always one of those interfaces:

```
type BaseNode = DocumentNode | PageNode | SceneNode
```

Most often, you will work with nodes contained within a page, also referred to as "scene nodes".

```
type SceneNode = BooleanOperationNode | CodeBlockNode | ComponentNode | ComponentSetNode | ConnectorNode | EllipseNode | EmbedNode | FrameNode | GroupNode | HighlightNode | InstanceNode | InteractiveSlideElementNode | LineNode | LinkUnfurlNode | MediaNode | PolygonNode | RectangleNode | SectionNode | ShapeWithTextNode | SliceNode | SlideGridNode | SlideNode | SlideRowNode | StampNode | StarNode | StickyNode | TableNode | TextNode | TextPathNode | TransformGroupNode | VectorNode | WashiTapeNode | WidgetNode
```

Each node has a type property that tells you the type of the node. The list of node types is declared in NodeType. **You will typically use `node.type` when examining a node.**

```
type NodeType = "BOOLEAN_OPERATION" | "CODE_BLOCK" | "COMPONENT" | "COMPONENT_SET" | "CONNECTOR" | "DOCUMENT" | "ELLIPSE" | "EMBED" | "FRAME" | "GROUP" | "HIGHLIGHT" | "INSTANCE" | "INTERACTIVE_SLIDE_ELEMENT" | "LINE" | "LINK_UNFURL" | "MEDIA" | "PAGE" | "POLYGON" | "RECTANGLE" | "SECTION" | "SHAPE_WITH_TEXT" | "SLICE" | "SLIDE" | "SLIDE_GRID" | "SLIDE_ROW" | "STAMP" | "STAR" | "STICKY" | "TABLE" | "TABLE_CELL" | "TEXT" | "TEXT_PATH" | "TRANSFORM_GROUP" | "VECTOR" | "WASHI_TAPE" | "WIDGET"
```

In the Typings File, you will also find references to "mixin" interfaces. This is just a way to group related properties together. For example: pages, frames and groups can all have children, so they all have children-related properties such as `.children`, `.appendChild`.

Our node properties can't be modeled using traditional object-oriented class hierarchy which is why we use the concept of mixins. The `ChildrenMixin` define the properties that all nodes with children have (e.g. append, insert) and `FrameNode`s, `PageNode`s, etc all compose `ChildrenMixin`. However, a `RectangleNode` cannot have children and therefore does not inherit from `ChildrenMixin`.

### BooleanOperationNode

Boolean operations combine any set of shape layers through one of four formulas: Union, Subtract, Intersect, and Exclude. The layers to be combined are stored in its `children` array. You can create boolean operation nodes using `figma.union`, `figma.subtract`, `figma.intersect`, `figma.exclude`.

Like the group node, the boolean operations node is always set to fit its children. As such, its position and size can change when you add or resize its children.

More information on how boolean operations work can be found on our help page.

#### Boolean operation properties

##### type: 'BOOLEAN_OPERATION' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "BOOLEAN_OPERATION"

---

##### clone(): [BooleanOperationNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/BooleanOperationNode/)

Duplicates the boolean operation node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

---

##### booleanOperation: 'UNION' | 'INTERSECT' | 'SUBTRACT' | 'EXCLUDE'

The type of operation used to combine the children of this node.

---

##### expanded: boolean

Whether this container is shown as expanded in the layers panel.

---

#### Base node properties

##### [id](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as `figma.get Node By Id Async`, but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.



---

In Figma and Dev Mode, this shows up in the properties panel. In FigJam, this shows up in the property menu. See here for examples.



---

##### getRelaunchData(): { [command: string]: string }

Retreives the reluanch data stored on this node using `set Relaunch Data`

---

##### isAsset: boolean [readonly]

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if you're building a plugin for code generation.

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

##### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a plugin for code generation.

```

### findAll

Searches the entire document tree. Returns all nodes for which `callback` returns true.

If the manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, you must first call `figma.load All Pages Async` to access this function.

Supported on:

- Document Node

#### Signature

##### [findAll](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/DocumentNode-findall/)(callback?: (node: [PageNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/PageNode/) | [SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)) => boolean): Array<[PageNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/PageNode/) | [SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)>

#### Parameters

##### callback

A function that evaluates whether to return the provided `node`. If this argument is omitted, `findAll` returns all nodes in the subtree.

#### Remarks

Nodes are included in **back-to-front** order. Parents always appear before their children, and children appear in same relative order before their children, and children appear in same relative order as in the `children` array.

This traversal method is known as "pre-order traversal").

Note that the root node itself is **not included**.

Example: find all nodes whose name is "Color":

```
await figma.loadAllPagesAsync() // call this once when the plugin runsconst colors = figma.root.findAll(n => n.name === "Color")
```

⚠ Large documents in Figma can have tens of thousands of nodes. Be careful using this function as it could be very slow. Please refer to our recommendations for how to optimize document traversals.

### findOne

Searches this entire page (this node's children, its children's children, etc.). Returns the first node for which `callback` returns true.

If the manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, you must first call `figma.load All Pages Async` to access this function.

#### Parameters

##### callback

A function that evaluates whether to return the provided `node`.

#### Remarks

This function returns `null` if no matching node is found. The traversal order is the same as in `find All`.

Note that the root node itself is **not included**.

Example: find one node whose name is "Template":

```
await figma.loadAllPagesAsync() // call this once when the plugin runsconst template = figma.root.findOne(n => n.name === "Template")
```

⚠ Large documents in Figma can have tens of thousands of nodes. Be careful using this function as it could be very slow. Please refer to our recommendations for how to optimize document traversals.

### findWidgetNodesByWidgetId

### FrameNode

The frame node is a container used to define a layout hierarchy. It is similar to `<div>` in HTML. It is different from `Group Node`, which is closer to a folder for layers. Frames can be created using `figma.create Frame`.

Frames generally have their own size, though the size can be determined by that of its children in the case of auto-layout frames.

> ⚠️ It is possible for a user to convert a frame into a group via the UI, and vice-versa. If you hold onto a node in a long-running plugin, you can't assume its `type` never changes.

### GroupNode

The group node is a container used to semantically group related nodes. You can think of them as a folder in the layers panel. It is different from `Frame Node`, which defines layout and is closer to a `<div>` in HTML. Groups can be created by grouping existing nodes using `figma.group`.

Groups in Figma are always positioned and sized to fit their content. As such, while you can move or resize a group, you should also expect that a group's position and size will change if you change its content. See the `relative Transform` page for more details.

In Figma, groups must always have children. A group with no children will delete itself.

> ⚠️ It is possible for a user to convert a frame into a group via the UI, and vice-versa. If you hold onto a node in a long-running plugin, you can't assume its `type` never changes.

#### Applying constraints to groups

When using the Figma UI, you can change the constraints of a group to control how the group and its children respond when the user resizes them. Under the hood, Figma applies the provided constraints to each child of the group.

To change the constraints of a group via the API, you must iterate through the group's children and apply `Constraints` to each child's `constraints` property:

Applying STRETCH constraints to all children of a group

```
const groupNode = figma.currentPage.selection[0]groupNode.children.forEach((child) => { child.constraints = { horizontal: 'STRETCH', vertical: 'STRETCH' }})
```

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as `figma.get Node By Id Async`, but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.



---

##### [parent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-parent/): ([BaseNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#base-node) & [ChildrenMixin](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/node-properties/#children-mixin)) | null [readonly]

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see `append Child`.



---

##### [name](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-name/): string

The name of the layer that appears in the layers panel. Calling `figma.root.name` will return the name, read-only, of the current file.



---

##### [removed](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.



---

##### [toString](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)(): string

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.



---

##### [remove](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-remove/)(): void

Removes this node and **all of its children** from the document.

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

##### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a plugin for code generation.

---

##### getTopLevelFrame(): [FrameNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/FrameNode/) | undefined

Returns the top-most frame that contains this node. If the node is not inside a frame, this will return undefined.

This function will only work in Figma Design and will throw an error if called in FigJam or Slides.

### guides

The guides on this page.

Supported on:

- Page Node

#### Signature

##### [guides](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/PageNode-guides/): ReadonlyArray<[Guide](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Guide/)>

#### Remarks

Like many of our array properties, `page.guide` creates a new, read-only array every time it is called. To change the guides, you will need to make a copy of the existing array and/or assign a new array.

Example:

```
function addNewGuide(page: PageNode, guide: Guide) { // .concat() creates a new array page.guides = page.guides.concat(guide)}
```

### selection

The selected nodes on this page. Each page stores its own selection separately. The ordering of nodes in the selection is **unspecified**, you should not be relying on it.

Supported on:

- Page Node

#### Signature

##### [selection](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/PageNode-selection/): ReadonlyArray<[SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)>

#### Remarks

Like many of our array properties, `page.selection` returns a new, read-only array every time it is called (the nodes inside are references to existing nodes, not copies). To change the selection, you will need to make a copy of the existing array and/or assign a new array.

Example:

```
function addNewNodeToSelection(page: PageNode, node: SceneNode) { // .concat() creates a new array page.selection = page.selection.concat(node)}function selectFirstChildOfNode(page: PageNode, node: SceneNode) { if (node.children.length > 0) { page.selection = [node.children[0]] }}
```

- As the selection is just a node property, the selection is preserved when the user switches between pages.
- Nodes in the selection are unique. When setting the selection, the API will de-deduplicate nodes in the selection. This API could have been a `Set<SceneNode>`, but it's generally easier to work with array and to get the first node using just selection[0].
- Only **directly selected nodes** are present in this array. A node is directly selected when it is selected and none of its ancestors are selected. That means the array will never contain both a node and one of its descendents.

#### Possible error cases

`Cannot select the document node`

`Cannot select the page node`

`The selection of a page can only include nodes in that page`

### selectedTextRange

The current text node being edited, if any, and the text currently being selected within that text node.

Supported on:

- Page Node

#### Signature

##### [selectedTextRange](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/PageNode-selectedtextrange/): { node: [TextNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/TextNode/); start: number; end: number } | null

#### Remarks

This property will return `null` if there is no text node being edited. Setting this property to a `node` will enter text edit mode on that `node`. Leaving text edit mode will set this value to `null`.

When `start == end`, it means that no characters is currently selected -- i.e., there is just a cursor.

Changing `selectedTextRange` will trigger a `selectionchange` message.

### flowStartingPoints

The sorted list of flow starting points used when accessing Presentation view.

Supported on:

- Page Node

#### Signature

##### [flowStartingPoints](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/PageNode-flowstartingpoints/): ReadonlyArray<{ nodeId: string; name: string }>

#### Remarks

The default starting point is the first one (e.g., used when no frames are selected and you click the toolbar's play icon to enter Presentation view).

### on

Registers a callback that will be invoked when an event occurs on the page. Current supported events are:

- `"nodechange"`: Emitted when a node is added, removed, or updated.

Supported on:

- Page Node

#### Signature

##### [on](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/PageNode-on/)(type: 'nodechange', callback: (event: [NodeChangeEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/NodeChangeEvent/)) => void): void

#### Parameters

##### type

The type of event to listen for.

##### callback

The callback to be invoked when the event occurs.

#### Remarks

#### Available event types

##### `"nodechange"`

This event will be emitted when a node on the page is added, removed, or updated.

The callback will receive a NodeChangeEvent with the below interface:

```
interface NodeChangeEvent { nodeChanges: NodeChange[]}
```

There are 3 different `Node Change` types. Each of these changes has a `type` property to distinguish them:

| Change | `type` property | Description |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Create Change` | `'CREATE'` | A node has been created in the page. If a node with nested children is being added to the page a `CreateChange` will only be made for the highest level parent that was added to the page. |
| `Delete Change` | `'DELETE'` | A node has been removed from the page. If a node with nested children is being removed from the page a `DeleteChange`will only be made for the highest level parent that was removed from the page. |
| `Property Change` | `'PROPERTY_CHANGE'` | A property of a node has changed. |

### off

Removes a callback added with `on` or `once`.

Supported on:

- Page Node

#### Signature

##### [off](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/PageNode-off/)(type: 'nodechange', callback: (event: [NodeChangeEvent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/NodeChangeEvent/)) => void): void

#### Remarks

The callback needs to be the same object that was originally added. For example, you can do this:

Correct way to remove a callback

```
let fn = () => { console.log("nodechange") }page.on("nodechange", fn)page.off("nodechange", fn)
```

whereas the following won't work, because the function objects are different:

Incorrect way to remove a callback

```
page.on("nodechange", () => { console.log("nodechange") })page.off("nodechange", () => { console.log("nodechange") })
```

#### Remarks

- "NONE": The size of the textbox is fixed and is independent of its content.
- "HEIGHT": The width of the textbox is fixed. Characters wrap to fit in the textbox. The height of the textbox automatically adjusts to fit its content.
- "WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT": Both the width and height of the textbox automatically adjusts to fit its content. Characters do not wrap.
- [DEPRECATED] "TRUNCATE": Like "NONE", but text that overflows the bounds of the text node will be truncated with an ellipsis. This value will be removed in the future - prefer reading from `text Truncation` instead.

### textTruncation

Whether this text node will truncate with an ellipsis when the text node size is smaller than the text inside.

Supported on:

- Text Node

#### Signature

##### [textTruncation](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/TextNode-texttruncation/): 'DISABLED' | 'ENDING'

#### Remarks

When `text Auto Resize` is set to `"NONE"`, the text will truncate when the fixed size is smaller than the text inside. When it is `"HEIGHT"` or `"WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT"`, truncation will only occur if used in conjunction with `max Height` or `max Lines`.


### maxLines

The maximum number of lines a text node can reach before it truncates. Only applicable when `text Truncation` is set to `"ENDING"`.

Supported on:

- Text Node

#### Signature

Supported on:

- Text Node

#### Signature

##### [autoRename](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/TextNode-autorename/): boolean

#### Remarks

This is automatically reset to false if `name` is modified in order to allow the node to keep the new name.

### TextPathNode

Text on a path is available in beta. The API is subject to change.

A text path node allows text to follow along a vector path while maintaining text styling capabilities. Like regular text nodes, text paths have styling properties such as color (fills), font size, and font name that can be applied to either the entire node or individual character ranges.

Text paths have a subset of the properties from Text Nodes, as well as a few path-specific properties that define the underlying vector geometry. When working with text, there are a lot of things to consider, including mixed styles, loading fonts, and missing fonts. Please refer to the Working with Text page for more information.

### VectorNode

The vector node is our most general representation of shape, allowing you to specify individual vertices, segments, and regions. They are typically created in the UI using the pen tool, pencil tool, or when flattening a selection. Learn more about vector networks on our help page. Vectors can be created using `figma.create Vector`.

Note that similarly to groups, `VectorNode`s' position and size are automatically adjusted to fit its vertices. For example, the positions returned by `vectorPaths` is relative to the vector object position. That position will update as you change the vector content. That means that after setting a value to `vectorPaths`, reading the same value again may give a different result than what you originally set.

#### Signature

##### `addDevResourceAsync(url: string, name?: string): Promise<void>`

#### Parameters

##### url

The url of the dev resource.

##### name

The name of the dev resource. If not provided, Figma will get the name from the url.

### appendChild

Adds a new child to the end of the `children` array. That is, visually on top of all other children.

If the manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, **and** the node is a `Page Node`, you must first call `load Async` to access this function.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Instance Node
- Page Node
- Section Node
- Slide Grid Node
- Slide Node
- Slide Row Node
- Transform Group Node

#### Signature

##### [appendChild](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/)(child: [SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)): void

#### Remarks

Reparenting nodes is subject to many restrictions. For example, some nodes cannot be moved, others would break the document if moved. Below are possible exceptions that can be thrown if the operation is invalid.

If this is called on an auto-layout frame, calling this function can cause this layer to be resized and children to be moved.

### appendChildAt

Applicable only on auto-layout frames with `layoutMode` set to `"GRID"`. Appends a node to the grid at the specified row and column index.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [appendChildAt](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-appendchildat/)(node: [SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node), rowIndex: number, columnIndex: number): void

#### Remarks

If the specified row or column index is out of bounds, it will throw an error. If the specified row or column index is occupied by another node, it will throw an error. If the node is already a child of the grid, it will be removed from its current position and appended to the new position.

Appending a node to a grid at a specific row and column index

```

```


### characters

The raw characters in the text node. Setting this property requires the font the be loaded.

Supported on:

- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Text Sublayer Node

#### Signature

##### [characters](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/TextNode-characters/): string

#### Remarks

Setting this property will reset styles applied to character ranges.

Setting the `characters` property can change the `name` of the node if `autoRename === true`.

### children

The list of children, sorted back-to-front. That is, the first child in the array is the bottommost layer on the screen, and the last child in the array is the topmost layer.

If the manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, **and** the node is a `Page Node`, you must first call `load Async` to access this property.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Instance Node
- Page Node
- Section Node
- Slide Grid Node
- Slide Node
- Slide Row Node
- Transform Group Node

#### Signature

##### [children](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-children/): ReadonlyArray<[SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)> [readonly]

#### Remarks

This array can be read like and iterated like a regular array. However, calling this property always returns a new array, and both the property and the new array are read-only.

As such, this property cannot be assigned to, and the array cannot be modified directly (it wouldn't do anything). Instead, use `append Child`, `insert Child` or `remove`.

If you are curious, the reason why inserting children has to be done via API calls is because our internal representation for the layer tree uses fractional indexing and `insert Child` performs that conversion.

#### Signature

##### clearExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection: [VariableCollection](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/VariableCollection/)): void

#### Parameters

##### collection

A variable collection. Make sure to pass a collection object here; passing a variable collection ID is deprecated.

### componentPropertyDefinitions

All component properties and their default values that exist on this component set. `'VARIANT'` properties will also have a list of all variant options. `'BOOLEAN'`, `'TEXT'`, and `'INSTANCE_SWAP'` properties will have their names suffixed by a unique identifier starting with `'#'`, which is helpful for quickly distinguishing multiple component properties that have the same name in the Figma UI. The entire property name should be used for all Component property-related API methods and properties.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node

#### Signature

##### [componentPropertyDefinitions](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/ComponentPropertiesMixin-componentpropertydefinitions/): [ComponentPropertyDefinitions](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/ComponentPropertyDefinitions/) [readonly]

#### Remarks

Component properties-related properties define parts of the component people can change by tying them to specific design properties. You can create component properties for any main component or component set, and apply them to nested layers of the component or variant.

### constraints

Constraints of this node relative to its containing `Frame Node`, if any.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node
- Line Node
- Polygon Node
- Rectangle Node
- Slide Node
- Stamp Node
- Star Node
- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Vector Node

#### Signature

##### [constraints](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-constraints/): [Constraints](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Constraints/)

#### Remarks

Not all node types have a constraint property. In particular, Group and BooleanOperation nodes do not have a constraint property themselves. Instead, resizing a frame applies the constraints on the children of those nodes.

### cornerRadius

The number of pixels to round the corners of the object by.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node
- Polygon Node
- Rectangle Node
- Slide Node
- Star Node
- Vector Node

#### Signature

##### [cornerRadius](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-cornerradius/): number | [figma.mixed](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-mixed/)

#### Remarks

This value must be non-negative and can be fractional. If an edge length is less than twice the corner radius, the corner radius for each vertex of the edge will be clamped to half the edge length.

This property can return `figma.mixed` if different vertices have different values.properties. Vector nodes can have individual corner radii on each vertex. Rectangle nodes can also have different corner radii on each of the four corners.

### cornerSmoothing

A value that lets you control how "smooth" the corners are. Ranges from 0 to 1.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node
- Polygon Node
- Rectangle Node
- Slide Node
- Star Node
- Vector Node

#### Signature

##### [cornerSmoothing](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-cornersmoothing/): number

#### Remarks

A value of 0 is the default and means that the corner is perfectly circular. A value of 0.6 means the corner matches the iOS 7 "squircle" icon shape. Other values produce various other curves. See this post for the gory details!

### counterAxisAlignContent

Applicable only on auto-layout frames with `layout Wrap` set to `"WRAP"`. Determines how the wrapped tracks are spaced out inside of the auto-layout frame.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [counterAxisAlignContent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-counteraxisaligncontent/): 'AUTO' | 'SPACE_BETWEEN'

#### Remarks

Changing this property on a non-wrapping auto-layout frame will throw an error.

- `"AUTO"`: If all children of this auto-layout frame have `layout Align` set to `"STRETCH"`, the tracks will stretch to fill the auto-layout frame. This is like flexbox `align-content: stretch`. Otherwise, each track will be as tall as the tallest child of the track, and will align based on the value of `counter Axis Align Items`. This is like flexbox `align-content: start | center | end`. `counter Axis Spacing` is respected when `counterAxisAlignContent` is set to `"AUTO"`.
- `"SPACE_BETWEEN"`: Tracks are all sized based on the tallest child in the track. The free space within the auto-layout frame is divided up evenly between each track. If the total height of all tracks is taller than the height of the auto-layout frame, the spacing will be 0.
### counterAxisAlignItems

Applicable only on "HORIZONTAL" or "VERTICAL" auto-layout frames. Determines how the auto-layout frame’s children should be aligned in the counter axis direction.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [counterAxisAlignItems](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-counteraxisalignitems/): 'MIN' | 'MAX' | 'CENTER' | 'BASELINE'

#### Remarks

Changing this property will cause all the children to update their `x` and `y` values.

- In horizontal auto-layout frames, `“MIN”` and `“MAX”` correspond to top and bottom respectively.
- In vertical auto-layout frames, `“MIN”` and `“MAX”` correspond to left and right respectively.
- `"BASELINE"` can only be set on horizontal auto-layout frames, and aligns all children along the text baseline.

The corresponding property for the primary axis direction is `primary Axis Align Items`.

Horizontal auto-layout frame with different counterAxisAlignItems values

```
(async () => { const parentFrame = figma.createFrame() const text = figma.createText() await figma.loadFontAsync(text.fontName) text.characters = 'asdf' // Make the text taller so we can see how text baseline alignment works text.lineHeight = {unit: 'PERCENT', value: 300} // Auto-layout frame will have 2 children: a frame and a text node parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame()) parentFrame.appendChild(text) parentFrame.layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL' // Make the parent frame taller so we can see the effects of // the different counterAxisAlignItems values parentFrame.resize(200, 150) // Parent frame // +--------------------------+ // |+-----------++----+ | // || || | | // || Child 1 ||asdf| | // || || | | // |+-----------++----+ | // | | // | | // +--------------------------+ parentFrame.counterAxisAlignItems = 'MIN' // Parent frame // +--------------------------+ // | | // | | // |+-----------++----+ | // || || | | // || Child 1 ||asdf| | // || || | | // |+-----------++----+ | // +--------------------------+ parentFrame.counterAxisAlignItems = 'MAX' // Parent frame // +--------------------------+ // | | // |+-----------++----+ | // || || | | // || Child 1 ||asdf| | // || || | | // |+-----------++----+ | // | | // +--------------------------+ parentFrame.counterAxisAlignItems = 'CENTER' // Parent frame // +--------------------------+ // |+-----------+ | // || |+----+ | // || Child 1 || | | // || ||asdf| | // |+-----------+| | | // | +----+ | // | | // +--------------------------+ parentFrame.counterAxisAlignItems = 'BASELINE'})()
```

### counterAxisSizingMode

Applicable only on auto-layout frames. Determines whether the counter axis has a fixed length (determined by the user) or an automatic length (determined by the layout engine).

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [counterAxisSizingMode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-counteraxissizingmode/): 'FIXED' | 'AUTO'

#### Remarks

Auto-layout frames have a **primary axis**, which is the axis that resizes when you add new items into the frame. For example, frames with "VERTICAL" `layout Mode` resize in the y-axis.

The other axis is called the **counter axis**.

- `"FIXED"`: The counter axis length is determined by the user or plugins, unless the `layout Align` is set to “STRETCH” or `layout Grow` is 1.
- `"AUTO"`: The counter axis length is determined by the size of the children. If set, the auto-layout frame will automatically resize along the counter axis to fit its children.

Note: `“AUTO”` cannot be used in any axes where `layout Align` = “STRETCH” or `layout Grow` = 1. Either use `“FIXED”` or disable `layout Align`/`layout Grow`.

Horizontal auto-layout frame with different counterAxisSizingMode values

```
const parentFrame = figma.createFrame()const child2 = figma.createFrame()// Make the second child 200px high instead of the default 100pxchild2.resize(100, 200)parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())parentFrame.appendChild(child2)parentFrame.layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'// Parent frame// +--------------------------+// |+-----------++-----------+|// || || ||// || Child 1 || Child 2 ||// || || ||// |+-----------+| ||// +--------------------------+parentFrame.counterAxisSizingMode = 'FIXED' // Child 2 is clipped// Parent frame// +--------------------------+// |+-----------++-----------+|// || || ||// || Child 1 || Child 2 ||// || || ||// |+-----------+| ||// | | ||// | | ||// | +-----------+|// +--------------------------+parentFrame.counterAxisSizingMode = 'AUTO'
```

### counterAxisSpacing

Applicable only on "HORIZONTAL" or "VERTICAL" auto-layout frames with `layout Wrap` set to `"WRAP"`. Determines the distance between wrapped tracks. The value must be positive.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [counterAxisSpacing](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-counteraxisspacing/): number | null

#### Remarks

Set this propety to `null` to have it sync with `item Spacing`. This will never return `null`. Once set to `null`, it will start returning the value of `item Spacing`.

Auto-layout frame with children wrapping to the next line

```
const parentFrame = figma.createFrame()parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())// Make children flow horizontally and wrapparentFrame.layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'parentFrame.layoutWrap = 'WRAP'// Set a fixed width so when we set itemSpacing below, the children will wrapparentFrame.primaryAxisSizingMode = 'FIXED'// Let the height of the parent frame resize to fit the childrenparentFrame.counterAxisSizingMode = 'AUTO'// Horizontal gap between childrenparentFrame.itemSpacing = 10// Parent frame// +------------------------------------------+// |+-----------+ +-----------+ |// || | | | |// || Child 1 | -- 10 -- | Child 2 | |// || | | | |// |+-----------+ +-----------+ |// | | |// | | |// | 20 |// | | |// | | |// |+-----------+ |// || | |// || Child 3 | |// || | |// |+-----------+ |// +------------------------------------------+parentFrame.counterAxisSpacing = 20
```


### deleteCharacters

Remove characters in the text from `start` (inclusive) to `end` (exclusive).

Supported on:

- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Text Sublayer Node

#### Signature

##### [deleteCharacters](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/TextNode-deletecharacters/)(start: number, end: number): void

#### Remarks

This API allows you to remove characters in a text node while preserving the styles of the existing characters. However, you still need to call `figma.load Font Async` before using this API.

⚠ Did you know: not all glyphs that you might think as a "character" are actually stored as a single character in JavaScript string? JavaScript strings are UTF-16 encoded. Some characters like "👍" are stored using two characters! Try it in the JavaScript console: "👍".length is 2! The two characters are called "surrogate pairs". Even more mindblowing: some characters are made of multiple _emojis_. For example, "👨‍👧", which you should see in your browser as a single character, has length 5. "👨‍👧".substring(0, 2) is "👨" and "👨‍👧".substring(3, 5) is "👧".

```
(async () => { // Create a triangle using the VectorPath API const vector = figma.createVector() vector.vectorPaths = [{ windingRule: "EVENODD", data: "M 0 100 L 100 100 L 50 0 Z", }] // Export the vector to SVG const svg = await vector.exportAsync({ format: 'SVG_STRING' }) console.log(svg); })()
```

Export a node as a JSON object

```
(async () => { const json = await figma.currentPage.selection[0].exportAsync({format: 'JSON_REST_V1'}) // Return a JSON object in the same format as the Figma REST API response console.log(json.document)})()
```

### fillStyleId

The id of the `Paint Style` object that the `fills` property of this node is linked to.

#### Remarks

This property can return `figma.mixed` if the node has multiple sets of fills. Text nodes can have multiple sets of fills if some characters are colored differently than others.

Use `solid Paint` to create solid paint fills with CSS color strings.

Page nodes have a `backgrounds` property instead of a `fills` property.

### findAll

Searches this entire subtree (this node's children, its children's children, etc). Returns all nodes for which `callback` returns true.

If the manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, **and** the node is a `Page Node`, you must first call `load Async` to access this function.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Instance Node
- Page Node
- Section Node
- Slide Grid Node
- Slide Node
- Slide Row Node
- Transform Group Node

#### Signature

##### [findAll](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-findall/)(callback?: (node: [SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)) => boolean): [SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)[]

#### Parameters

##### callback

A function that evaluates whether to return the provided `node`. If this argument is omitted, `findAll` returns all nodes in the subtree.

#### Remarks

Nodes are included in **back-to-front** order. Parents always appear before their children, and children appear in same relative order before their children, and children appear in same relative order as in the `children` array.

This traversal method is known as "pre-order traversal").

Note that the node this method is called on is **not included**.

Example: find all nodes whose name is "Color":

```
const colors = figma.currentPage.findAll(n => n.name === "Color")
```

⚠ Large documents in Figma can have tens of thousands of nodes. Be careful using this function as it could be very slow. If you only need to search immediate children, it is much faster to call `node.children.filter(callback)` or `node.findChildren(callback)`. Please refer to our recommendations for how to optimize document traversals.

### findAllWithCriteria

Searches this entire subtree (this node's children, its children's children, etc). Returns all nodes that satisfy all of specified criteria.

If the manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, **and** the node is a `Page Node`, you must first call `load Async` to access this function.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Instance Node
- Page Node
- Section Node
- Slide Grid Node
- Slide Node
- Slide Row Node
- Transform Group Node

#### Signature

##### `[findAllWithCriteria](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-findallwithcriteria/)<T extends NodeType[]>(criteria: [FindAllCriteria](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/FindAllCriteria/)<T>): Array<{ type: T[number] } & [SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)>`

#### Parameters

##### criteria

An object of type `Find All Criteria` that specifies the search criteria. The following criterias are currently supported:

- Nodes with specific `types`
- Nodes with `Shared Plugin Data` by their namespace and keys.
- Nodes with `Plugin Data` by their keys.
- A combination of any of the above.

#### Remarks

This is a faster but more limited search compared to `find All`, which lets you search nodes based on any logic you can include in a callback.

When paired with `figma.skip Invisible Instance Children = true`, this method can be hundreds of times faster in large documents with tens of thousands of nodes.

The return value is narrowly typed to match the provided `types`, which makes it much easier to use node-type-specific properties. For example, `node.findAllWithCriteria({ types: ['TEXT'] })` will return `TextNode[]` instead of the more generic `SceneNode[]` from `find All`.

Nodes are included in **back-to-front** order, which is the same order as in `find All`. Parents always appear before their children, and children appear in same relative order before their children, and children appear in same relative order as in the `children` array.

This traversal method is known as "pre-order traversal").

The node this method is called on is **not included**.

#### Example Usages

##### Find by node type

```
// Find all component and component set nodes in the current// pageconst nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({ types: ['COMPONENT', 'COMPONENT_SET']})// Find all text nodes in the current pageconst nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({ types: ['TEXT']})
```

##### Find by plugin data

```
// Find all nodes in the current page with plugin data// for the current plugin.const nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({ pluginData: {}})// Find all nodes in the current page with plugin data// for the current plugin with keys "a" or "b"const nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({ pluginData: { keys: ["a", "b"] }})
```

##### Find by shared plugin data

```
// Find all nodes in the current page with shared plugin data// stored on the "bar" namespaceconst nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({ sharedPluginData: { namespace: "bar" }})// Find all nodes in the current page with shared plugin data// stored on the "bar" namespace and keys "a" or "b"const nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({ sharedPluginData: { namespace: "bar", keys: ["a", "b"] }})
```

##### Combining criterias

You can combine multiple criterias for further narrow your search.

```
// Find all text nodes in the current page with plugin data// for the current pluginconst nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({ types: ["TEXT"], pluginData: {}})// Find all text nodes in the current page with shared plugin data// stored on the "bar" namespaceconst nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({ types: ["TEXT"], sharedPluginData: { namespace: "bar" }})
```

#### Parameters

##### widgetId

The widget ID to search for, which represents unique identifier for the widget.

#### Remarks

`node.widgetId` is not to be confused with `node.id`, which is the unique identifier for the node on the canvas. In other words, if you clone a widget, the cloned widget will have a matching `widgetId` but a different `id`.

```

Node containing:

- Item 1
- **Item** 1.1

```
textNode.getStyledTextSegments(['fontName', 'indentation'])// Output: contains 3 segments because the font / indentation changes// before and after the second "Item"[ { characters: 'Item 1\n', start: 0, end: 7, fontName: { family: 'Inter', style: 'Regular' }, indentation: 1 }, { characters: 'Item', start: 7, end: 11, fontName: { family: 'Inter', style: 'Bold' }, indentation: 2 }, { characters: ' 1.1', start: 11, end: 15, fontName: { family: 'Inter', style: 'Regular' }, indentation: 2 }]
```

Node containing "😁 😭 😅😂😳😎":

```
textNode.getStyledTextSegments(['letterSpacing'])// Output: many emoji have length 2 in Javascript[ { characters: '😁😭', start: 0, end: 4, letterSpacing: { unit: 'PERCENT', value: 50 } }, { characters: '😅😂😳😎', start: 4, end: 12, letterSpacing: { unit: 'PERCENT', value: 0 } }]textNode.getStyledTextSegments(['letterSpacing'], 1, 3)// Output: if the requested range starts or ends in the middle// of surrogate pairs, those pairs will be trimmed and you will// see raw Unicode code points[ { characters: '\uDE01\uD83D', start: 1, end: 3, letterSpacing: { unit: 'PERCENT', value: 50 } }]textNode.getStyledTextSegments(['letterSpacing'], 3, 5)// Output: similar to above, but Unicode code points span// a change in letter spacing[ { characters: '\uDE2D', start: 3, end: 4, letterSpacing: { unit: 'PERCENT', value: 50 } }, { characters: '\uD83D', start: 4, end: 5, letterSpacing: { unit: 'PERCENT', value: 0 } }]

#### Signature

##### [gridColumnAnchorIndex](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-gridcolumnanchorindex/): number [readonly]

#### Remarks

The column index is 0-based, where 0 is the first column in the grid. This property works in conjunction with gridColumnSpan to determine the node's column position and size in the grid. If the index provided is greater than the number of columns in the grid, the setter will throw an error. If the index provided results in the node overlapping with another node in the grid, the setter will throw an error.


### gridColumnCount

Applicable only on auto-layout frames with `layoutMode` set to `"GRID"`. Determines the number of columns in the grid.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node

#### Signature

##### [gridColumnCount](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-gridcolumncount/): number

#### Remarks

If the setter for this value is called on a grid with a value less than 1, it will throw an error. Users cannot remove columns from a grid if they are occupied by children, so if you try to reduce the count of columns in a grid and some of those columns have children, it will throw an error. By default, when the column count is increased, the new columns will be added as `Grid Track Size` objects with type `"FLEX"`. If you want to change the type of the new columns, you can use the setters on GridTrackSize objects returned by `grid Row Sizes` or `grid Column Sizes`.


### gridColumnGap

Applicable only on auto-layout frames with `layoutMode` set to `"GRID"`. Determines the gap between columns in the grid.

Supported on:

- Component Node

##### [gridRowAnchorIndex](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-gridrowanchorindex/): number [readonly]

#### Remarks

The row index is 0-based, where 0 is the first row in the grid. This property works in conjunction with gridRowSpan to determine the node's row position and size in the grid. If the index provided is greater than the number of rows in the grid, the setter will throw an error. If the index provided results in the node overlapping with another node in the grid, the setter will throw an error.

### gridRowCount

Applicable only on auto-layout frames with `layoutMode` set to `"GRID"`. Determines the number of rows in the grid.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [gridRowCount](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-gridrowcount/): number

#### Remarks

If the setter for this value is called on a grid with a value less than 1, it will throw an error. Users cannot remove rows from a grid if they are occupied by children, so if you try to reduce the count of rows in a grid and some of those rows have children, it will throw an error. By default, when the row count is increased, the new rows will be added as `Grid Track Size`objects with type `"FLEX"`. If you want to change the type of the new rows, you can use the setters on GridTrackSize objects returned by `grid Row Sizes` or `grid Column Sizes`.

Grid layout with 2 rows and 3 columns

```
const parentFrame = figma.createFrame()parentFrame.layoutMode = 'GRID'parentFrame.gridRowCount = 2parentFrame.gridColumnCount = 3// Grid frame with 2 rows and 3 columns// + --- + --- + --- +// | | | |// + --- + --- + --- +// | | | |// + --- + --- + --- +
```


### gridRowGap

Applicable only on auto-layout frames with `layoutMode` set to `"GRID"`. Determines the gap between rows in the grid.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [gridRowGap](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-gridrowgap/): number

#### Remarks

If the setter for this value is called on a grid with a value less than 0, it will throw an error.

### gridRowSizes

Only applicable on auto-layout frames with `layoutMode` set to `"GRID"`. Returns an array of `Grid Track Size` objects representing the rows in the grid in order.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [gridRowSizes](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-gridrowsizes/): Array<[GridTrackSize](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/GridTrackSize/)>

#### Remarks

The order of the rows is from top to bottom. The `Grid Track Size` can be used to change the type of the row (either `"FLEX"` or `"FIXED"`) and the size of the track (if it is a `"FIXED"`track).

Grid layout with mixed track sizes and types

```
const parentFrame = figma.createFrame()parentFrame.layoutMode = 'GRID'parentFrame.gridRowCount = 2parentFrame.gridColumnCount = 3// Change the first row to be a fixed size of 100pxparentFrame.gridRowSizes[0].type // 'FLEX'parentFrame.gridRowSizes[0].value = 100parentFrame.gridRowSizes[0].type // 'FIXED'// Grid with one fixed row and one flexible rows// + --- + --- + --- +// | | | | 100px height// + --- + --- + --- +// | | | |// | | | | 'flex' height// | | | | occupies remaining height in the container, because there is only one flex row.// | | | |// + --- + --- + --- +
```

### gridRowSpan

Applicable only on direct children of grid auto-layout frames. Determines the number of rows this node will span within the parent grid.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node
- Line Node
- Polygon Node
- Rectangle Node
- Slice Node
- Slide Node
- Stamp Node
- Star Node
- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Transform Group Node
- Vector Node
- Washi Tape Node

#### Signature

##### [gridRowSpan](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-gridrowspan/): number

#### Remarks

Must be a positive integer. This property defines how many rows the node will occupy starting from gridRowAnchorIndex. If the span provided results in the node overlapping with another node in the grid, the setter will throw an error. If the span provided results in the node extending beyond the grid's defined rows, the setter will throw an error.

### id

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as `figma.get Node By Id Async`, but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Code Block Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Connector Node
- Document Node
- Ellipse Node
- Embed Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node
- Interactive Slide Element Node
- Line Node
- Link Unfurl Node
- Media Node
- Page Node
- Polygon Node
- Rectangle Node
- Section Node
- Shape With Text Node
- Slice Node

- Slide Node
- Slide Row Node
- Stamp Node
- Star Node
- Sticky Node
- Table Node
- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Transform Group Node
- Vector Node
- Washi Tape Node
- Widget Node

#### Signature

##### [id](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

#### Remarks

One possible use case for using the `id` is to have a serializable representation of a Figma node. To "deserialize" an id back into a node, pass it to `figma.get Node By Id Async`. This will return null if the node is no longer present in the document.

In the URLs for Figma files, node ids are hyphenated. However, for use with the API, node ids must use colons. For example, if a Figma file URL has the node id `1-3`, you must convert it to `1:3`.

### inferredVariables

An object, keyed by field, returning any variables that match the raw value of that field for the mode of the node (or the default variable value if no mode is set)

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Code Block Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Connector Node
- Ellipse Node
- Embed Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node
- Interactive Slide Element Node
- Line Node
- Link Unfurl Node
- Media Node
- Polygon Node
- Rectangle Node
- Section Node
- Shape With Text Node
- Slice Node
- Slide Grid Node
- Slide Node
- Slide Row Node
- Stamp Node
- Star Node
- Sticky Node
- Table Node
- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Transform Group Node
- Vector Node
- Washi Tape Node
- Widget Node

#### Signature

##### [inferredVariables](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-inferredvariables/)?: { readonly [field in [VariableBindableNodeField](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/VariableBindableNodeField/)]?: [VariableAlias](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/VariableAlias/)[]} & { fills: [VariableAlias](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/VariableAlias/)[][]; strokes: [VariableAlias](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/VariableAlias/)[][] } [readonly]

#### Remarks

Inferred variables are only returned for a field when it is not using a bound variable.

Variables can be inferred from:

- The collections of variables used in the file
- Variables from subscribed libraries, provided the variable is used in the file

Variables can only be inferred when there is a single variable that matches the raw value used for the scope of the variable.

- i.e. For a property set to width: 100px, where there are two variables set to a value of 100 with the default scope, a value cannot be inferred as there are two matches.
- i.e. For a property set to width: 100px, where there is a variable set to 100 with a scope of "Width and height" and a variable set to 100 with a scope of "Corner radius", a value can be inferred as there is a single match for the given scope.

Inferred variables for fills and strokes return a list of results where the index matches that of node.fills and node.strokes.

- i.e. node.inferredVariables.fills[0] holds the inferred variables for node.fills[0]

### insertCharacters

Insert `characters` at index `start` in the text.

Supported on:

- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Text Sublayer Node

#### Signature

##### [insertCharacters](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/TextNode-insertcharacters/)(start: number, characters: string, useStyle?: 'BEFORE' | 'AFTER'): void

#### Remarks

This API allows you to insert characters in a text node while preserving the styles of the existing characters. However, you still need to call `figma.load Font Async` before using this API.

The style of the inserted characters will be copied from the preceding character if `useStyle`is "BEFORE" or not provided. Otherwise, the style of inserted characters will be copied from the following character. If there is no preceding or following character (i.e. `start` is at the boundary of the string), then the style will be copied from the closest existing character.

⚠ Did you know: not all glyphs that you might think as a "character" are actually stored as a single character in JavaScript string? JavaScript strings are UTF-16 encoded. Some characters like "👍" are stored using two characters! Try it in the JavaScript console: "👍".length is 2! The two characters are called "surrogate pairs". Even more mindblowing: some characters are made of multiple _emojis_. For example, "👨‍👧", which you should see in your browser as a single character, has length 5. "👨‍👧".substring(0, 2) is "👨" and "👨‍👧".substring(3, 5) is "👧".

### insertChild

Adds a new child at the specified index in the `children` array.

If the manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, **and** the node is a `Page Node`, you must first call `load Async` to access this function.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Instance Node
- Page Node
- Section Node
- Slide Grid Node
- Slide Node
- Slide Row Node
- Transform Group Node

#### Signature

##### [insertChild](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-insertchild/)(index: number, child: [SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)): void

#### Parameters

##### index

Determines where the new layer gets inserted. For example, suppose a group has layers A, B, C, where C is the top-most layer.

- `insertChild(0, D)` gives a group with layers **D**, A, B, C
- `insertChild(1, D)` gives a group with layers A, **D**, B, C
- `insertChild(2, D)` gives a group with layers A, B, **D**, C
- `insertChild(3, D)` gives a group with layers A, B, C, **D**
- `insertChild(4, D)` throws an error since the group originally only has 3 children

##### child

The node to be inserted.

#### Remarks

Reparenting nodes is subject to many restrictions. For example, some nodes cannot be moved, others would break the document if moved. Below are possible exceptions that can be thrown if the operation is invalid.

If this is called on an auto-layout frame, calling this function can cause this layer to be resized and children to be moved.


### isMask

Whether this node is a mask. A mask node masks its subsequent siblings.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node
- Line Node
- Polygon Node
- Rectangle Node
- Slide Node
- Stamp Node
- Star Node
- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Transform Group Node
- Vector Node
- Washi Tape Node

#### Signature

##### [isMask](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-ismask/): boolean

#### Remarks

Since a mask node masks all of its subsequent siblings, enabling `isMask` on a node that is not in a group-like container designed to stop mask propagation can have unintented consequences — that is, it may "mask" (often in practice, hide) more siblings than you intend. When enabling `isMask`, ensure you have contained its propagation propertly. ("Subsequent siblings" are siblings listed _after_ this node in a `children` array in the plugin API; this corresponds to layers shown _above_ this node in the layers panel.)

Example:

```
const rect = figma.createRectangle()const circleToMask = figma.createEllipse()const otherCircle1 = figma.createEllipse()const otherCircle2 = figma.createEllipse()// In the layers panel, this would look something like:// - otherCircle2// - otherCircle1// - circleToMask// - rect//// So if I enable `rect.isMask`, the rect will mask ALL other nodes,// because they are all siblings.//// If I only want `rect` to mask `circleToMask`, I should group// them first.figma.group([rect, circleToMask], figma.currentPage, figma.currentPage.children.indexOf(circleToMask))rect.isMask = true// Now `rect` only masks its siblings above it in its group// (`circleToMask`) but not the circles outside of the group.// In the layers panel this would look like:// - otherCircle2// - otherCircle1// - Group// - circleToMask [this is the only node masked by rect]// - rect (isMask)
```

### itemReverseZIndex

Applicable only on "HORIZONTAL" or "VERTICAL" auto-layout frames. Determines the canvas stacking order of layers in this frame. When true, the first layer will be draw on top.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [itemReverseZIndex](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-itemreversezindex/): boolean

#### Remarks

Auto-layout frame with different canvas stacking

```
const parentFrame = figma.createFrame()// Create red and green children so we can see the overlapconst child1 = figma.createFrame()child1.fills = [{ type: 'SOLID', color: { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0 }}]const child2 = figma.createFrame()child2.fills = [{ type: 'SOLID', color: { r: 0, g: 1, b: 0 }}]parentFrame.appendChild(child1)parentFrame.appendChild(child2)parentFrame.layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'// Negative horizontal gap between children so they overlapparentFrame.itemSpacing = -20// Parent frame (last child on top)// +---------------------+// |+-------+-----------+|// || | ||// ||Child 1| Child 2 ||// || | ||// |+-------+-----------+|// +---------------------+parentFrame.itemReverseZIndex = false// Parent frame (first child on top)// +---------------------+// |+-----------+-------+|// || | ||// || Child 1 |Child 2||// || | ||// |+-----------+-------+|// +---------------------+parentFrame.itemReverseZIndex = true
```

### itemSpacing

Applicable only on "HORIZONTAL" or "VERTICAL" auto-layout frames. Determines distance between children of the frame.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [itemSpacing](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-itemspacing/): number

#### Remarks

For auto-layout frames with `layout Mode` set to `"HORIZONTAL"`, this is the horizontal gap between children. For auto-layout frames with `layout Mode` set to `"VERTICAL"`, this is the vertical gap between children.

Auto-layout frame with a horizontal gap between children

```
const parentFrame = figma.createFrame()parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())parentFrame.layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'// Parent frame// +------------------------------------+// |+-----------+ +-----------+|// || | | ||// || Child 1 | -- 20 -- | Child 2 ||// || | | ||// |+-----------+ +-----------+|// +------------------------------------+parentFrame.itemSpacing = 20
```

Auto-layout frame with a vertical gap between children

```

### layoutAlign

Applicable only on direct children of auto-layout frames. Determines if the layer should stretch along the parent’s counter axis. Defaults to `“INHERIT”`.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Line Node
- Polygon Node
- Rectangle Node
- Slice Node
- Slide Node
- Stamp Node
- Star Node
- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Transform Group Node
- Vector Node
- Washi Tape Node

#### Signature

##### [layoutAlign](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-layoutalign/): 'MIN' | 'CENTER' | 'MAX' | 'STRETCH' | 'INHERIT'

#### Remarks

Changing this property will cause the `x`, `y`, `size`, and `relativeTransform` properties on this node to change, if applicable (inside an auto-layout frame).

- Setting `"STRETCH"` will make the node "stretch" to fill the width of the parent vertical auto-layout frame, or the height of the parent horizontal auto-layout frame excluding the frame's padding.
- If the current node is an auto layout frame (e.g. an auto layout frame inside a parent auto layout frame) if you set layoutAlign to `“STRETCH”` you should set the corresponding axis – either `primary Axis Sizing Mode` or `counter Axis Sizing Mode` – to be`“FIXED”`. This is because an auto-layout frame cannot simultaneously stretch to fill its parent and shrink to hug its children.
- Setting `"INHERIT"` does not "stretch" the node.

⚠️ Previously, layoutAlign also determined counter axis alignment of auto-layout frame children. Counter axis alignment is now set on the auto-layout frame itself through `counter Axis Align Items`. Note that this means all layers in an auto-layout frame must now have the same counter axis alignment. This means `"MIN"`, `"CENTER"`, and `"MAX"` are now deprecated values of `layoutAlign`.

### layoutGrow

This property is applicable only for direct children of auto-layout frames. Determines whether a layer should stretch along the parent’s primary axis. 0 corresponds to a fixed size and 1 corresponds to stretch.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Line Node
- Polygon Node
- Rectangle Node
- Slice Node
- Slide Node
- Stamp Node
- Star Node
- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Transform Group Node
- Vector Node
- Washi Tape Node

#### Signature

##### [layoutGrow](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-layoutgrow/): number

#### Remarks

0 and 1 are currently the only supported values.

Note: If the current node is an auto-layout frame (e.g. an auto-layout frame inside a parent auto-layout frame) if you set `layoutGrow` to 1 you should set the corresponding axis – either `primary Axis Sizing Mode` or `counter Axis Sizing Mode` – to be `“FIXED”`. This is because an auto-layout frame cannot simultaneously stretch to fill its parent and shrink to hug its children.

### layoutMode

Determines whether this layer uses auto-layout to position its children. Defaults to "NONE".

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [layoutMode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-layoutmode/): 'NONE' | 'HORIZONTAL' | 'VERTICAL' | 'GRID'

#### Remarks

Changing this property will cause the position of the children of this layer to change as a side-effect. It also causes the size of this layer to change, since at least one dimension of auto-layout frames is automatically calculated.

As a consequence, note that if a frame has `layoutMode === "NONE"`, calling `layoutMode = "VERTICAL"; layoutMode = "NONE"` does not leave the document unchanged. Removing auto-layout from a frame does not restore the children to their original positions.

This property must be set to `"HORIZONTAL"` or `"VERTICAL"` in order for the `primary Axis Sizing Mode`, `counter Axis Sizing Mode`, `layout Wrap`, `primary Axis Align Items`, `counter Axis Align Items`, `counter Axis Align Content`, `padding Top`, `padding Bottom`, `padding Left`, `padding Right`, `item Spacing`, `counter Axis Spacing`, `item Reverse ZIndex`, and `strokes Included In Layout` properties to be applicable.

Auto-layout frame with horizontal layout

```
const parentFrame = figma.createFrame()parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())// Parent frame// +--------------------------+// |+-----------++-----------+|// || || ||// || Child 1 || Child 2 ||// || || ||// |+-----------++-----------+|// +--------------------------+parentFrame.layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'
```

Auto-layout frame with vertical layout

```
const parentFrame = figma.createFrame()parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())// Parent frame// +-------------+// |+-----------+|// || ||// || Child 1 ||// || ||// |+-----------+|// |+-----------+|// || ||// || Child 2 ||// || ||// |+-----------+|// +-------------+parentFrame.layoutMode = 'VERTICAL'
```

### layoutPositioning

This property is applicable only for direct children of auto-layout frames. Determines whether a layer's size and position should be dermined by auto-layout settings or manually adjustable.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Line Node
- Polygon Node
- Rectangle Node
- Slice Node
- Slide Node
- Stamp Node
- Star Node
- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Transform Group Node
- Vector Node
- Washi Tape Node

#### Signature

##### [layoutPositioning](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-layoutpositioning/): 'AUTO' | 'ABSOLUTE'

#### Remarks

Changing this property may cause the parent layer's size to change, since it will recalculate as if this child did not exist. It will also change this node's `x`, `y`, and `relativeTransform`properties.

- The default value of `"AUTO"` will layout this child according to auto-layout rules.
- Setting `"ABSOLUTE"` will take this child out of auto-layout flow, while still nesting inside the auto-layout frame. This allows explicitly setting `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`. `"ABSOLUTE"` positioned nodes respect constraint settings.

Auto-layout frame absolutely positioned red circle at the top-right corner

```
const parentFrame = figma.createFrame()parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())// Create a small red circleconst ellipse = figma.createEllipse()ellipse.resize(20, 20)ellipse.fills = [{ type: 'SOLID', color: { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0 }}]parentFrame.appendChild(ellipse)parentFrame.clipsContent = falseparentFrame.layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'// Enable absolute positioning so we can move the circleellipse.layoutPositioning = 'ABSOLUTE'// Center the circle on the top-right corner of the frameellipse.x = 90ellipse.y = -10// Make the circle stick to the top-right corner of the frameellipse.constraints = { horizontal: 'MAX', vertical: 'MIN' }
```

### layoutSizingHorizontal

Applicable only on auto-layout frames, their children, and text nodes. This is a shorthand for setting `layout Grow`, `layout Align`, `primary Axis Sizing Mode`, and `counter Axis Sizing Mode`. This field maps directly to the "Horizontal sizing" dropdown in the Figma UI.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node

#### Signature

##### [layoutSizingHorizontal](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-layoutsizinghorizontal/): 'FIXED' | 'HUG' | 'FILL'

#### Remarks

`"HUG"` is only valid on auto-layout frames and text nodes. `"FILL"` is only valid on auto-layout children. Setting these values when they don't apply will throw an error.

Setting layoutSizingHorizontal on an auto-layout frame

```
const parentFrame = figma.createFrame()const child2 = figma.createFrame()parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())parentFrame.appendChild(child2)parentFrame.layoutMode = 'VERTICAL'// Make the second child twice as wide as the firstchild2.resize(200, 100)// Parent frame (child 2 is clipped)// +-------------+// |+-----------+|// || ||// || Child 1 ||// || ||// |+-----------+|// |+------------|// || |// || Child 2 |// || |// |+------------|// +-------------+parentFrame.layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FIXED'// Parent frame (child 2 is not clipped)// +------------------------+// |+-----------+ |// || | |// || Child 1 | |// || | |// |+-----------+ |// |+----------------------+|// || ||// || Child 2 ||// || ||// |+----------------------+|// +------------------------+parentFrame.layoutSizingHorizontal = 'HUG'

#### Signature

##### [layoutSizingVertical](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-layoutsizingvertical/): 'FIXED' | 'HUG' | 'FILL'

#### Remarks

`"HUG"` is only valid on auto-layout frames and text nodes. `"FILL"` is only valid on auto-layout children. Setting these values when they don't apply will throw an error.

### layoutWrap

Determines whether this layer should use wrapping auto-layout. Defaults to `"NO_WRAP"`.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [layoutWrap](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-layoutwrap/): 'NO_WRAP' | 'WRAP'

#### Remarks

This property can only be set on layers with `layoutMode === "HORIZONTAL"`. Setting it on layers without this property will throw an Error.

This property must be set to `"WRAP"` in order for the `counter Axis Spacing` and `counter Axis Align Content` properties to be applicable.

### locked

Whether the node is locked or not, preventing certain user interactions on the canvas such as selecting and dragging. Does not affect a plugin's ability to write to those properties.

#### Remarks

The value that this property returns is independent from the node's parent. i.e.

- The node isn't necessarily locked if this is `.locked === true`.
- The node isn't necessarily unlocked if this is `.locked === false`.
- An object is locked if `.locked == true` for itself or **any** of its parents.

If the node is a `Text Node`, the name will update automatically by default based on the `characters` property (`autoRename` is true). If you manually override the text node's name, it will set `autoRename` to false. This matches the behavior in the editor.

If the node is a `Page Node` with no children and the name is a page divider name, it will set `isPageDivider` to true. A page divider name consists of all asterisks, all en dashes, all em dashes, or all spaces.

### numberOfFixedChildren

Determines which children of the frame are fixed children in a scrolling frame.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Frame Node
- Instance Node

#### Signature

##### [numberOfFixedChildren](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-numberoffixedchildren/): number

#### Remarks

In Figma, fixed children are always on top of scrolling (non-fixed) children. Despite the "Fix position when scrolling" checkbox in the UI, fixed layers are not represented as a boolean property on individual layers. Instead, what we really have are two sections of children inside each frame. These section headers are visible in the layers panel when a frame has at least one fixed child.

### openTypeFeatures

Open Type features that have been explicitly enabled or disabled.

Supported on:

- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Text Sublayer Node

#### Signature

##### [openTypeFeatures](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/TextNode-opentypefeatures/): { readonly [feature in [OpenTypeFeature](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/OpenTypeFeature/)]: boolean} | [figma.mixed](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-mixed/) [readonly]

#### Remarks

The **Details** tab in the Type settings panel shows all the OpenType features that are available for the current font.

This property gives you a map of four-character OpenType features to booleans indicating whether the features are explicitly enabled or disabled. For example, if the map contains `{ CALT: false }`, then the "Contextual alternates" feature is disabled.

This map only contains features that diverge from their default values. Some OpenType features are enabled by default and some are disabled by default. For example `CLIG` and `LIGA` are on by default, whereas `LNUM` and `TNUM` are disabled by default.

Here are some useful resources for learning about OpenType features:

- [An ode to OpenType [Figma blog]](https://www.figma.com/blog/opentype-font-features/)
- [OpenType feature tags [Microsoft]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/featuretags)
- [OpenType font features guide [MDN]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/OpenType_fonts_guide)
- [OpenType Features in CSS [Sparanoid]](https://sparanoid.com/lab/opentype-features/)

Getting OpenType features from the currently-selected text node

```
// For a node that uses the Inter font with// "Contextual alternates" disabled (shows -> instead of ➔):// { CALT: false }console.log(figma.currentPage.selection[0].openTypeFeatures)
```

### overflowDirection

Determines whether a frame will scroll in presentation mode when the frame contains content that exceed the frame's bounds. Reflects the value shown in "Overflow Behavior" in the Prototype tab.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Frame Node
- Instance Node

#### Signature

##### [overflowDirection](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-overflowdirection/): [OverflowDirection](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/OverflowDirection/)

#### Remarks

Frames directly parented under the canvas don't need this property to be set or for content to exceed the frame's bounds in order to scroll in presentation mode. They just need the frame to be bigger than the device or screen and will scroll automatically.

### parent

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see `append Child`.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Code Block Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Connector Node
- Document Node
- Ellipse Node
- Embed Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node

- Slide Grid Node
- Slide Node
- Slide Row Node
- Stamp Node
- Star Node
- Sticky Node
- Table Node
- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Transform Group Node
- Vector Node
- Washi Tape Node
- Widget Node

#### Signature

##### [parent](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-parent/): ([BaseNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#base-node) & [ChildrenMixin](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/node-properties/#children-mixin)) | null [readonly]

#### Remarks

The root node (i.e. `figma.root`) doesn't have a parent.

Components accessed via `instance.get Main Component Async()` or `instance.main Component` do not always have a parent. They could be remote components or soft-deleted components.

### primaryAxisAlignItems

Applicable only on "HORIZONTAL" or "VERTICAL" auto-layout frames. Determines how the auto-layout frame’s children should be aligned in the primary axis direction.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [primaryAxisAlignItems](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-primaryaxisalignitems/): 'MIN' | 'MAX' | 'CENTER' | 'SPACE_BETWEEN'

#### Remarks

Changing this property will cause all the children to update their `x` and `y` values.

- In horizontal auto-layout frames, `“MIN”` and `“MAX”` correspond to left and right respectively.
- In vertical auto-layout frames, `“MIN”` and `“MAX”` correspond to top and bottom respectively.
- `“SPACE_BETWEEN”` will cause the children to space themselves evenly along the primary axis, only putting the extra space between the children.

The corresponding property for the counter axis direction is `counter Axis Align Items`.

Horizontal auto-layout frame with different primaryAxisAlignItems values

```
const parentFrame = figma.createFrame()parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())parentFrame.appendChild(figma.createFrame())parentFrame.layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'// Make the parent frame wider so we can see the effects of// the different primaryAxisAlignItems valuesparentFrame.resize(300, 100)// Parent frame// +------------------------------------+// | +-----------++-----------+ |// | | || | |// | | Child 1 || Child 2 | |// | | || | |// | +-----------++-----------+ |// +------------------------------------+parentFrame.primaryAxisAlignItems = 'MIN'// Parent frame// +------------------------------------+// | +-----------++-----------+|// | | || ||// | | Child 1 || Child 2 ||// | | || ||// | +-----------++-----------+|// +------------------------------------+parentFrame.primaryAxisAlignItems = 'MAX'// Parent frame// +------------------------------------+// | +-----------++-----------+ |// | | || | |// | | Child 1 || Child 2 | |// | | || | |// | +-----------++-----------+ |// +------------------------------------+parentFrame.primaryAxisAlignItems = 'CENTER'// Parent frame// +------------------------------------+// |+-----------+ +-----------+|// || | | ||// || Child 1 | | Child 2 ||// || | | ||// |+-----------+ +-----------+|// +------------------------------------+parentFrame.primaryAxisAlignItems = 'SPACE_BETWEEN'
```

### primaryAxisSizingMode

Applicable only on auto-layout frames. Determines whether the primary axis has a fixed length (determined by the user) or an automatic length (determined by the layout engine).

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Frame Node
- Inferred Auto Layout Result
- Instance Node
- Slide Node

#### Signature

##### [primaryAxisSizingMode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-primaryaxissizingmode/): 'FIXED' | 'AUTO'

#### Remarks

Auto-layout frames have a **primary axis**, which is the axis that resizes when you add new items into the frame. For example, frames with "VERTICAL" `layout Mode` resize in the y-axis.

- `"FIXED"`: The primary axis length is determined by the user or plugins, unless the `layout Align` is set to “STRETCH” or `layout Grow` is 1.
- `"AUTO"`: The primary axis length is determined by the size of the children. If set, the auto-layout frame will automatically resize along the counter axis to fit its children.

Note: `“AUTO”` should not be used in any axes where `layout Align` = “STRETCH” or `layout Grow` = 1. Either use `“FIXED”` or disable `layout Align`/`layout Grow`.

### reactions

List of Reactions on this node, which includes both the method of interaction with this node in a prototype, and the behavior of that interaction. For help on how to change this value, see Editing Properties.

If the manifest contains`"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, this property is read-only. Use `setReactionsAsync` to update the value.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node
- Line Node
- Polygon Node
- Rectangle Node
- Stamp Node
- Star Node
- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Transform Group Node
- Vector Node
- Washi Tape Node

#### Signature

##### [reactions](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-reactions/): ReadonlyArray<[Reaction](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Reaction/)>

#### Remarks

Prototyping in Figma lets users create connections between nodes that consist of a trigger (click, hover, etc...) and a corresponding list of actions, such as navigating to another frame or setting a variable. The `reactions` property lets you read and modify prototyping reactions on the node.

Changing the transition duration in a prototyping action

```
const node = figma.currentPage.selection[0]console.log(node.reactions)/*Output:[{ action: { type: 'NODE', destinationId: '4:1539', navigation: 'NAVIGATE', transition: { type:'SMART_ANIMATE', easing: { type: 'EASE_OUT' }, duration: 0.20000000298023224 }, preserveScrollPosition: false }, actions: [{ type: 'NODE', destinationId: '4:1539', navigation: 'NAVIGATE', transition: { type:'SMART_ANIMATE', easing: { type: 'EASE_OUT' }, duration: 0.20000000298023224 }, preserveScrollPosition: false }], trigger: { type: 'ON_CLICK' }}]*/// See clone() implementation from the Editing Properties pageconst newReactions = clone(node.reactions)newReactions[0].actions[0].transition.duration = 0.5await node.setReactionsAsync(newReactions)
```

It is also possible to add Advanced Prototyping action types through the Plugin API: Set Variable and Conditional. Moreover, Reactions now include the ability to execute multiple actions by updating the `actions` field on a `Reaction`.

Create a button with a Reaction object that updates the visibility of another Frame.

```
(async () => { // Create collection with "show" variable inside const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection('prototyping') const modeId = collection.modes[0].modeId const showVariable = figma.variables.createVariable( 'show', collection, 'BOOLEAN' ) // Initialize "show" variable to true showVariable.setValueForMode(modeId, true) const parentFrame = figma.createFrame() parentFrame.resize(350, 200) // Green "Click me" button const toggleButton = figma.createFrame() parentFrame.appendChild(toggleButton) toggleButton.x = 50 toggleButton.y = 50 toggleButton.layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL' toggleButton.layoutSizingHorizontal = 'HUG' toggleButton.layoutSizingVertical = 'HUG' toggleButton.fills = [{ type: 'SOLID', color: { r: 0, g: 1, b: 0 } }] const text = figma.createText() await figma.loadFontAsync(text.fontName) text.characters = 'Click me' toggleButton.appendChild(text) // Red square const frame = figma.createFrame() parentFrame.appendChild(frame) frame.x = 200 frame.y = 50 frame.fills = [{ type: 'SOLID', color: { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0 } }] // The "show" variable will now control the visibility of the frame frame.setBoundVariable('visible', showVariable) await toggleButton.setReactionsAsync([ { trigger: { type: 'ON_CLICK' }, actions: [ { type: 'CONDITIONAL', conditionalBlocks: [ { condition: { // Conditional: if "show" variable == true type: 'EXPRESSION', resolvedType: 'BOOLEAN', value: { expressionArguments: [ { type: 'VARIABLE_ALIAS', resolvedType: 'BOOLEAN', value: { type: 'VARIABLE_ALIAS', id: showVariable.id } }, { type: 'BOOLEAN', resolvedType: 'BOOLEAN', value: true } ], expressionFunction: 'EQUALS' } }, actions: [ // then set "show" variable to false { type: 'SET_VARIABLE', variableId: showVariable.id, variableValue: { resolvedType: 'BOOLEAN', type: 'BOOLEAN', value: false } } ] }, { actions: [ // else set "show" variable to true { type: 'SET_VARIABLE', variableId: showVariable.id, variableValue: { resolvedType: 'BOOLEAN', type: 'BOOLEAN', value: true } } ] }] }] }])})()
```

### relativeTransform

The position of a node relative to its **containing parent** as a `Transform` matrix. Not used for scaling, see `width` and `height` instead. Read the details page to understand the nuances of this property.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Code Block Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Connector Node
- Ellipse Node
- Embed Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node
- Interactive Slide Element Node

- Slide Node
- Slide Row Node
- Stamp Node
- Star Node
- Sticky Node
- Table Node
- Text Node
- Text Path Node
- Transform Group Node
- Vector Node
- Washi Tape Node
- Widget Node

#### Signature

##### [relativeTransform](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-relativetransform/): [Transform](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Transform/)

#### Remarks

##### Scale

The `relativeTransform` is **not** used for scaling a node. The transform always has unit axes. That is, `sqrt(m00^2 + m10^2) == sqrt(m01^2 + m11^2) == 1`. In order to set the size of a node, use `resize` or `resize Without Constraints`.

If you have a background in computer graphics, you may find it odd that we use the transform matrix in such a manner. This is because in 2D UI design, it's rare that you would want to scale the children when resizing a frame. And even if you did, it would be through more nuanced constraint settings that aren't captured by a transformation matrix.

Also, if nodes had both a `width` and a separate `m00` scale property, it would be confusing to the users which one they're changing, especially during interactions like dragging.

##### Container parent

The relative transform of a node is shown relative to its container parent, which includes canvas nodes, frame nodes, component nodes, and instance nodes. Just like in the properties panel, it is **not** relative to its direct parent if the parent is a group or a boolean operation.

Example 1: In the following hierarchy, the relative transform of `rectangle` is relative to `page`(which is just its position on the canvas).

```
page group rectangle
```

Example 2: In the following hierarchy, the relative transform of `rectangle` is relative to `frame`.

```
page frame boolean operation rectangle
```

One implication is that to calculate the absolute position of a node, you have to either use the `absolute Transform` property or multiply relative transform matrices while traversing up the node hierarchy while ignoring groups and boolean operations.

Why this complication? We do it this way because groups and boolean operations automatically resize to fit their children. While you _can_ set the relative transform of a group to move it, it's a property derived from the position and size of its children. If the relative transform was always relative to it’s immediate parent, you could get into confusing situations where moving a layer inside a group by setting the relative transform changes the position of the parent, which then requires changing the relative transform of the child in order to preserve its on-screen position!

##### Skew

While it is possible to skew a layer by setting `m00`, `m01`, `m10`, `m11` to the right values, be aware that the skew will not be surfaced in the properties panel and may be confusing to the user dealing with a skewed node.

##### Auto-layout frames

The translation components `m02` and `m12` of the transform matrix is automatically computed in children of auto-layout frames. Setting `relativeTransform` on those layers will ignore the translation components, but do keep the rotation components.

#### Signature

##### [remove](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-remove/)(): void

#### Remarks

If you want to only remove this node but not its children, you will have to first move them to another node before calling `remove()`.

### removed

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Code Block Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Connector Node
- Document Node
- Ellipse Node
- Embed Node
- Frame Node

#### Signature

##### [removed](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

#### Remarks

A node can be removed for any number of reasons. Some examples:

- Your plugin called node.remove() on it
- Someone else deleted the node using multiplayer
- The user triggered an undo action and the node was removed
- The user simply deleted the node
- You removed all children out of a group, and the group auto-deleted itself

### rescale

Rescales the node. This API function is the equivalent of using the Scale Tool from the toolbar.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node

#### Signature

##### [rescale](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-rescale/)(scale: number): void

#### Parameters

##### scale

The scale by which to resize the node from the top-left corner.

#### Remarks

The scale factor must be >= 0.01

### resize

Resizes the node. If the node contains children with constraints, it applies those constraints during resizing. If the parent has auto-layout, causes the parent to be resized.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node
- Line Node
- Polygon Node

- Text Path Node
- Transform Group Node
- Vector Node
- Washi Tape Node

#### Signature

##### [resize](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-resize/)(width: number, height: number): void

#### Parameters

##### width

New width of the node. Must be >= 0.01

##### height

New height of the node. Must be >= 0.01, except for `Line Node` which must always be given a height of exactly 0.

#### Remarks

Since this function applies constraints recursively (when there are multiple levels of nested frames with constraints), calls to this function could be expensive. Use `resize Without Constraints` if you don't need to apply constraints.

⚠️ If this node is a text node with a missing font or contains a text node with a missing font, the text node will be resized but the text will not re-layout until the next time the text node is opened on a machine that _has_ the font. This can cause the text node to re-layout immediately and be surprising to your user. Consider checking if the document `figma.has Missing Font` before using this function.

Ignores `targetAspectRatio`. If `targetAspectRatio` has been set, it will be updated to correspond to the post-resize value.

### resizeWithoutConstraints

Resizes the node. Children of the node are never resized, even if those children have constraints. If the parent has auto-layout, causes the parent to be resized (this constraint cannot be ignored).

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Ellipse Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node
- Line Node
- Polygon Node

#### Signature

##### [resizeWithoutConstraints](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-resizewithoutconstraints/)(width: number, height: number): void

#### Parameters

##### width

New width of the node. Must be >= 0.01

##### height

New height of the node. Must be >= 0.01, except for `Line Node` which must always be given a height of exactly 0.

#### Remarks

This function will not cause its children to resize. Use `resize` if you need to apply constraints.

⚠️ If this node is a text node with a missing font, the text node will be resized but the text will not re-layout until the next time the text node is opened on a machine that _has_ the font. This can cause the text node to re-layout immediately and be surprising to your user. Consider checking the text node property `has Missing Font` before using this function.

Ignores `targetAspectRatio`. If `targetAspectRatio` has been set, it will be updated to correspond to the post-resize value.


### resizeWithoutConstraints

⚠️ If this node is a text node with a missing font, the text node will be resized but the text will not re-layout until the next time the text node is opened on a machine that _has_ the font. This can cause the text node to re-layout immediately and be surprising to your user. Consider checking the text node property `has Missing Font` before using this function.

Ignores `targetAspectRatio`. If `targetAspectRatio` has been set, it will be updated to correspond to the post-resize value.

### rotation

The rotation of the node in degrees. Returns values from -180 to 180. Identical to `Math.atan2(-m10, m00)` in the `relative Transform` matrix. When setting `rotation`, it will also set `m00`, `m01`, `m10`, `m11`.

Supported on:

#### Signature

##### [setGridChildPosition](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-setgridchildposition/)(rowIndex: number, columnIndex: number): void

#### Remarks

This method sets the position of the node within the grid based on the specified row and column indices. The row and column indices are 0-based, where 0 is the top row in the grid, and 0 is the left-most column in the grid. If the specified row or column index is out of bounds, it will throw an error. If the specified row or column index is occupied by another node, it will throw an error.

#### Signature

##### [setPluginData](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-setplugindata/)(key: string, value: string): void

#### Parameters

##### key

The key under which to store the data. This is similar to writing to a plain object via `obj[key] = value`.

##### value

The data you want to store. If you want to store a value type other than a string, encode it as a JSON string first via `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`. If you set the value to the empty string (""), the key/value pair is removed.

#### Remarks

The data is specific to your plugin ID. Plugins with other IDs won't be able to read this data. You can retrieve it later by calling `getPluginData` with the same key. To find all data stored on a node or style by your plugin use `getPluginDataKeys`.

⚠ The data is stored privately for **stability**, not **security**. It prevents other plugins from accessing with your data. It does not, however, prevent users from seeing the data given sufficient effort. For example, they could export the document as a .fig file and try to decode it.

⚠ Data will become inaccessible if your plugin ID changes.

⚠ Total entry size cannot exceed 100 kB.

### setRelaunchData

Sets state on the node to show a button and description when the node is selected. Clears the button and description when `relaunchData` is `{}`.

In Figma and Dev Mode, this shows up in the properties panel. In FigJam, this shows up in the property menu. See here for examples.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Code Block Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Connector Node
- Document Node
- Ellipse Node
- Embed Node
- Frame Node
- Group Node
- Highlight Node
- Instance Node

- Washi Tape Node
- Widget Node

#### Signature

##### [setRelaunchData](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)(data: { [command: string]: string }): void

#### Parameters

##### data

```
{ [command: string]: string // description}
```

e.g. `data = { myCommand: 'Short description' }`

##### command

The string that will be passed as `figma.command` when the plugin is run after the button is clicked. This command must be present in the manifest under one of the `relaunchButtons`, which is used to look up the name to display for the button.

##### description

Up to three lines of text that will be displayed under the button to provide plugin specific information about the node or any clarification about the action the button will perform. This method will throw if description exceeds 1000 characters, but the UI will display even less (only 3 lines).

#### Remarks

Each call to this method sets entirely new relaunch data, removing any relaunch data and associated buttons/descriptions from before. To maintain buttons from a previous call one can store the button information using set Plugin Data and later fetch it with get Plugin Databefore passing it on to `setRelaunchData`.

To use this API, the plugin manifest must include a `relaunchButtons` section: see the manifest guide for more information.

Note that if the `command` passed to this method does not match a command in the manifest, nothing will be displayed. Similarly if the name of a command in the manifest changes or is removed, then all buttons with that command will disappear. This behavior can be used to remove buttons when a particular action is no longer supported by the plugin.

In Figma design, the relaunch data can also be placed on the `Page Node` or `Document Node`, to show a button and description when nothing is selected. Relaunch buttons added to the `Page Node` will be displayed on that page, combined with buttons from the `Document Node`that show on every page. This is not supported in FigJam.

#### Examples

manifest.json

```
// With the following in the manifest:"relaunchButtons": [ {"command": "edit", "name": "Edit shape"}, {"command": "open", "name": "Open Shaper", "multipleSelection": true}]
```

code.ts

```
// Add two buttons (ordered by the above array from the manifest):// * an "Edit shape" button with a description of "Edit this trapezoid// with Shaper" that runs the plugin with `figma.command === 'edit'`.// * an "Open Shaper" button with no description that runs the plugin with// `figma.command === 'open'`.node.setRelaunchData({ edit: 'Edit this trapezoid with Shaper', open: '' })// With the following in the manifest:"relaunchButtons": [ {"command": "relaunch", "name": "Run again", "multipleSelection": true}]// Pass an empty description to show only a buttonnode.setRelaunchData({ relaunch: '' })// Remove the button and descriptionnode.setRelaunchData({})
```

### setSharedPluginData

Lets you store custom information on any node or style, **public** to all plugins. The total size of your entry (`namespace`, `key`, `value`) cannot exceed 100 kB.

#### Signature

##### [setSharedPluginData](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-setsharedplugindata/)(namespace: string, key: string, value: string): void

#### Parameters

##### namespace

A unique string to identify your plugin and avoid key collisions with other plugins. The namespace must be at least 3 alphanumeric characters.

##### key

The key under which to store the data. This is similar to writing to a plain object via `obj[key] = value`.

##### value

The data you want to store. If you want to store a value type other than a string, encode it as a JSON string first via `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`. If you set the value to the empty string (""), the key/value pair is removed.

#### Remarks

This lets you store custom information on any node or style. You can retrieve it later by calling `get Shared Plugin Data` with the same namespace and key. To find all data stored on a node or style in a particular namespace, use `get Shared Plugin Data Keys`.

Any data you write using this API will be readable by any plugin. The intent is to allow plugins to interoperate with each other. Use `set Plugin Data` instead if you don't want other plugins to be able to read your data.

You must also provide a `namespace` argument to avoid key collisions with other plugins. This argument is mandatory to prevent multiple plugins from using generic key names like `data`and overwriting one another. We recommend passing a value that identifies your plugin. This namespace can be given to authors of other plugins so that they can read data from your plugin.

⚠ Total entry size cannot exceed 100 kB.

### strokeAlign

The alignment of the stroke with respect to the boundaries of the shape.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Connector Node

- Washi Tape Node

#### Signature

##### [strokeAlign](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-strokealign/): 'CENTER' | 'INSIDE' | 'OUTSIDE'

#### Remarks

Center-aligned stroke means the center of the stroke falls exactly on the geometry. Inside-aligned stroke shifts the stroke so it lies completely inside the shape, and outside-aligned stroke is vice versa.

Inside and outside stroke are actually implemented by doubling the stroke weight and masking the stroke by the fill. This means inside-aligned stroke will never draw strokes outside the fill and outside-aligned stroke will never draw strokes inside the fill.

### strokeCap

The decoration applied to vertices which have only one connected segment.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node

#### Remarks

Use `lockAspectRatio` and `unlockAspectRatio` to set targetAspectRatio.

```
const parentFrame = figma.createFrame()const image = await figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync( <figma.widget.Image src="https://picsum.photos/200/300" width={200} height={300} />)parentFrame.appendChild(image)image.lockAspectRatio() // set to 2:3 ratio, implicit from the size// Add autolayout to parent, which defaults to Hug x HugparentFrame.layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'// Set child to fill-widthimage.layoutGrow = 1// Resize parent to be much largerparentFrame.resize(500, 1000)// Since the child is fill-width, it will expand to the available spaceimage.width == 500image.height == 750// Image maintains the 2:3 ratio even as it grew with auto layout!
```

⚠️ `targetAspectRatio` cannot be used with auto-resizing text (TextNodes where textAutoResize !== NONE).

### toString

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

Supported on:

- Boolean Operation Node
- Code Block Node
- Component Node
- Component Set Node
- Connector Node
- Document Node
- Ellipse Node
- Embed Node
- Frame Node

#### Signature

##### [toString](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)(): string

#### Remarks

This currently returns a string of the form `[Node ID]` where `ID` is the id of the node. This is just for debugging convenience so the node displays something useful when converted to a string. We recommend not relying on this in production.

Example:

```
// e.g. [Node 0:5]console.log(`Current selected node ${figma.currentPage.selection[0]}`)
```

### variantProperties

**DEPRECATED:** Use `component Properties` instead.

Variant properties and values for this node. Is `null` for nodes that are not variants.

Supported on:

- Component Node
- Instance Node

#### Signature

##### [variantProperties](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-variantproperties/): { [property: string]: string } | null [readonly]

#### Remarks

Variant properties define attributes of variants in a component set. For example, a component set for a button might have variant properties such as `size` and `state`, with different possible values for each property (e.g. `default`, `hover`, `pressed`, and `disabled`for the `state` property).

Variant-related properties and methods for component sets, components, and instances

```
componentSet.variantGroupProperties// Output{ Size: { values: ['Small', 'Medium', 'Large'] }, State: { values: ['Default', 'Hover', 'Pressed', 'Disabled'] }}// One of the variants / component nodes in the component setcomponentSet.children[1].variantProperties// Output{ Size: 'Small', State: 'Hover' }// variantProperties also works on an instances of variantsinstance.variantProperties// Output{ Size: 'Medium', State: 'Default' }// Use setProperties on an instance of a variant to configure itinstance.setProperties({ Size: 'Large' })instance.variantProperties// Output{ Size: 'Large', State: 'Default' }

## Data Types
To assist you with writing your plugin code, we provide a TypeScript typings file for the entire Plugin API.

The typings file is a collection of type and interface declarations you can use for type checking. These declarations represent groups of related properties, parameters, and other data sets you’ll interact with.

You’ll see **types** and **interfaces** in a few places:

- To get and set properties on nodes or global objects
- Passed as parameters in a function
- Returned by a method

Types and interfaces come in varying levels of complexity.

- Choose one option from a list of values, like `Blend Mode`.
- Support a mixture of required and optional properties. You’ll see a “?” at the end of any optional properties.
- Offer different properties based on the outcome you want to achieve, like `Connector Endpoint`.
- Support or reference other types and interfaces, like `Paint` and `Effect`.

### Action

```
type Action = { readonly type: "BACK" | "CLOSE" } | { readonly type: "URL", url: string } | { readonly type: "UPDATE_MEDIA_RUNTIME", readonly destinationId: string | null, readonly mediaAction: | "PLAY" | "PAUSE" | "TOGGLE_PLAY_PAUSE" | "MUTE" | "UNMUTE" | "TOGGLE_MUTE_UNMUTE" } | { readonly type: "UPDATE_MEDIA_RUNTIME", readonly destinationId?: string | null, readonly mediaAction: "SKIP_FORWARD" | "SKIP_BACKWARD" readonly amountToSkip: number } | { readonly type: "UPDATE_MEDIA_RUNTIME", readonly destinationId?: string | null, readonly mediaAction: "SKIP_TO" readonly newTimestamp: number } | { readonly type: 'SET_VARIABLE' readonly variableId: string | null readonly variableValue?: VariableData } | { readonly type: 'SET_VARIABLE_MODE' readonly variableCollectionId: string | null readonly variableModeId: string | null } | { readonly type: 'CONDITIONAL' readonly conditionalBlocks: ConditionalBlock[] } { readonly type: "NODE", readonly destinationId: string | null, readonly navigation: Navigation, readonly transition: Transition | null, readonly preserveScrollPosition?: boolean, readonly overlayRelativePosition?: Vector, readonly resetVideoPosition?: boolean, readonly resetScrollPosition?: boolean, readonly resetInteractiveComponents?: boolean, }type Navigation = "NAVIGATE" | "SWAP" | "OVERLAY" | "SCROLL_TO" | "CHANGE_TO"
```

A prototyping `Action` describes interactivity in prototypes. Specifically, "what happens?" upon a `Trigger`.

#### "BACK" action

This action navigates to the previously opened frame by popping the navigation history.

#### "CLOSE" action

This action closes the current topmost overlay (applicable only on overlays).

#### "URL" action

This action opens an external URL specified in the `url: string` parameter. If `openInNewTab: boolean` is set, a new browser tab will be opened.

#### "UPDATE_MEDIA_RUNTIME" action

This action alters the playing status of all video fills on the destination node. If `destinationId` is not set, then it will update video fills on the current node.

`mediaAction: MediaAction` determines

- `"PLAY"`: Plays the video.
- `"PAUSE"`: Pauses the video.
- `"TOGGLE_PLAY_PAUSE"`: Plays the video if it is paused, and pauses the video if it is playing.
- `"MUTE"`: Mutes the video.
- `"UNMUTE"`: Unmutes the video.
- `"TOGGLE_MUTE_UNMUTE`"`: Mutes the video if it is unmuted, and unmutes the video if it is muted.
- `"SKIP_FORWARD"`: Jumps forward in time in the video. An `amountToSkip` must be provided (in seconds).
- `"SKIP_BACKWARD"`: Jumps backward in time in the video. An `amountToSkip` must be provided (in seconds).
- `"SKIP_TO"`: Jumps to a specific timestamp in the video. A `newTimestamp` must be provided (in seconds).

#### "SET_VARIABLE" action

Variables are stored values that represent design attributes or saved states. They can be string, number, color, or boolean value types. This action can set and modify the values of variables in prototypes.

- `variableId`: string: The variable ID of an existing variable that an action will modify.
- `variableValue`: `VariableData`: The value we want to set variableId during the prototyping. The value can be a boolean, float, string, color, variable or expression.

Important data types:

- `VariableDataType`: Defines the types of data a VariableData object can hold

```
type VariableDataType = 'BOOLEAN' | 'FLOAT' | 'STRING' | 'VARIABLE_ALIAS' | 'COLOR' | 'EXPRESSION'
```

- `VariableResolvedDataType`: Defines the types of data a VariableData object can eventually equal

```
type VariableResolvedDataType = 'BOOLEAN' | 'COLOR' | 'FLOAT' | 'STRING'
```

- `ExpressionFunction`: Defines the list of operators available to use in an Expression

```
type ExpressionFunction = | 'ADDITION' | 'SUBTRACTION' | 'MULTIPLICATION' | 'DIVISION' | 'EQUALS' | 'NOT_EQUAL' | 'LESS_THAN' | 'LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL' | 'GREATER_THAN' | 'GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL' | 'AND' | 'OR' | 'VAR_MODE_LOOKUP' | 'NEGATE' | 'NOT'
```

- `VariableData`: Defines an object which contains a value, VariableDataType and VariableResolvedDataType.

```
interface VariableData = { type?: VariableDataType resolvedType?: VariableResolvedDataType value?: number | boolean | string | RGB | RGBA | VariableAlias | Expression}
```

- `Expression`: Defines the Expression object, which contains a list of `VariableData`objects strung together by operators (`ExpressionFunction`). This is essentially just a mathematical statement.

```
interface Expression { expressionFunction: ExpressionFunction expressionArguments: VariableData[]}
```

_Note that the `Expression` and `VariableData` objects can be recursive_

Example of creating an expression with strings

```
// $StringVariable + " Figma"const stringExpression = { expressionArguments: [ { resolvedType: 'STRING', type: 'VARIABLE_ALIAS', value: { type: 'VARIABLE_ALIAS', id: "$StringVariableID", }, }, { resolvedType: 'STRING', type: 'STRING', value: " Figma", } ], expressionFunction: 'ADDITION',}
```

Example of creating a Set Variable action using the expression from above

```
const value = { resolvedType: 'STRING', type: 'EXPRESSION', value: stringExpression}const setStringVariableAction = { type: 'SET_VARIABLE', variableId: "$StringVariableID", variableValue: value,}
```

#### "SET_VARIABLE_MODE" action

Variable modes represent the different contexts of our designs. If a variable collection has multiple modes, then we can switch modes on layers and elements to quickly change designs for different contexts.

This action can switch the selected mode for a given collection at a page level.

- `variableCollectionId`: string: The variable collection ID of an existing variable collection.
- `variableModeId`: string: The variable mode ID of a mode that exists in the corresponding variable collection, which the action will switch to.

Example of creating a set variable mode reaction on a frame

```
const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("collection")const newModeId = collection.addMode("mode 2")const setModeAction = { type: 'SET_VARIABLE_MODE', variableCollectionId: collection.id, variableModeId: newModeId,}const reactions = [];reactions.push({ "actions": [setModeAction], "trigger": { "type": "ON_CLICK" }});// Add an "on click" interaction, with a "set variable mode" action// with the just-created collection and second mode.const hotspot = figma.createFrame()await hotspot.setReactionsAsync(reactions);console.log(hotspot.reactions)/* Output:[ { "action": { "type": "SET_VARIABLE_MODE", "variableCollectionId": "VariableCollectionId:0:1", "variableModeId": "1:1" }, "actions": [ { "type": "SET_VARIABLE_MODE", "variableCollectionId": "VariableCollectionId:0:1", "variableModeId": "1:1" } ], "trigger": { "type": "ON_CLICK" } }]*/
```

#### "CONDITIONAL" action

This action checks if a condition is met before performing certain actions by using an if/else conditional statement.

- `conditionalBlocks`: `ConditionalBlock[]`: Either the if or else conditional blocks. The if block contains a condition to check. If that condition is met then it will run those list of actions, else it will run the actions in the else block.

Important data type:

```
type ConditionalBlock = { condition?: VariableData actions: Action[]}
```

Example of creating a condition with multiple expressions

```
// $NumberVariable > 10const numberEvaluationExpression = { expressionArguments: [ { resolvedType: "FLOAT", type: "VARIABLE_ALIAS", value: { type: 'VARIABLE_ALIAS', id: "$NumberVariableID", }, }, { resolvedType: "FLOAT", type: "FLOAT", value: 10 } ], expressionFunction: "GREATER_THAN"}// $NumberVariable > 10 && $BooleanVariableconst conditionData = { resolvedType: "BOOLEAN", type: "EXPRESSION", value: { expressionArguments: [ { resolvedType: "BOOLEAN", type: "EXPRESSION", value: numberEvaluationExpression }, { resolvedType: "BOOLEAN", type: "VARIABLE_ALIAS", value: { type: 'VARIABLE_ALIAS', id: "$BooleanVariableID", }, } ], expressionFunction: "AND", },}
```

Example of creating ConditionalBlocks with the condition from above

```
const navigateAction1 = { type: 'NODE', navigation: 'NAVIGATE', transition: null, destinationId: "$Frame1ID",}const navigateAction2 = { type: 'NODE', navigation: 'NAVIGATE', transition: null, destinationId: "$Frame2ID",}const conditionalIfBlock = { condition: conditionData, actions: [navigateAction1],}const conditionalElseBlock = { actions: [navigateAction2],}
```

Example of creating a Conditional action with the ConditionalBlocks from above

```
const conditionalAction = { type: 'CONDITIONAL', conditionalBlocks: [conditionalIfBlock, conditionalElseBlock],}
```

#### "NODE" action

This action navigates to a new node.

`destinationId: string | null`: The ID of the destination node being navigated to. This may be null when invalid (e.g. points to a deleted node).

`navigation: Navigation`: The method of navigation. The possible values are:

- `"NAVIGATE"`: Replaces the current screen with the destination, also closing all overlays.
- `"OVERLAY"`: Opens the destination as an overlay on the current screen.
- `"SWAP"`: On an overlay, replaces the current (topmost) overlay with the destination. On a top-level frame, behaves the same as `"NAVIGATE"` except that no entry is added to the navigation history.
- `"SCROLL_TO"`: Scrolls to the destination on the current screen.
- `"CHANGE_TO"`: Changes the closest ancestor instance of source node to the specified variant.

`transition: Transition | null`: An animated transition when navigating, if any. See the `Transition` object type.

`preserveScrollPosition?: boolean`: Whether the scroll offsets of any scrollable elements in the current screen or overlay are preserved when navigating to the destination. This is applicable only if the layout of both the current frame and its destination are the same.

`overlayRelativePosition?: Vector`: Applicable only when `navigation` is `"OVERLAY"`and the destination is a frame with `overlayPosition` equal to `"MANUAL"`. This value represents the offset by which the overlay is opened relative to this node.

`resetVideoPosition?: boolean`: When true, all videos within the destination frame will reset their memorized playback position to 00:00 before starting to play.

`resetScrollPosition?: boolean`: Whether the scroll offsets of any scrollable elements in the current screen or overlay are reset when navigating to the destination. This is applicable only if the layout of both the current frame and its destination are the same.

`resetInteractiveComponents?: boolean`: Whether the state of any interactive components in the current screen or overlay are reset when navigating to the destination. This is applicable if there are interactive components in the destination frame.

### ActiveUser

The `ActiveUser` object contains details about a user in a Figma file.

##### id: string | null [readonly]

The user's id. `id` will be automatically generated users in workshop mode. `id` will also be automatically generated for the current user if they are not logged in. For other non-logged in users, this value will be null.

Annotations let you add notes and pin properties to nodes in Dev Mode.

The `annotations` field is supported on the following node types: Component Node, Component Set Node, Ellipse Node, Frame Node, Instance Node, Line Node, Polygon Node, Rectangle Node, Star Node, Text Node, Vector Node.

#### Annotation properties

```
interface Annotation { readonly label?: string readonly labelMarkdown?: string readonly properties?: ReadonlyArray<AnnotationProperty> readonly categoryId?: string}
```

See Annotation Property for supported properties.

#### Annotation node properties

### ArcData

```
interface ArcData { readonly startingAngle: number readonly endingAngle: number readonly innerRadius: number}
```

This data controls the "arc" properties of the circle shape:

The angles are in radians and the inner radius value is from 0 to 1. For the angles, 0° is the x axis and increasing angles rotate clockwise.

Examples:

```
// Make a half-circlenode.arcData = {startingAngle: 0, endingAngle: Math.PI, innerRadius: 0}
```

```
// Make a donutnode.arcData = {startingAngle: 0, endingAngle: 2 * Math.PI, innerRadius: 0.5}
```

### BaseUser

The `BaseUser` object contains details about a user that was in a file at some point. They may not be active in the file.

##### id: string | null [readonly]

The user's id. `id` will be automatically generated users in workshop mode. `id` will also be automatically generated for the current user if they are not logged in. For other non-logged in users, this value will be null.

---

##### name: string [readonly]

The user's name. `name` will be 'Anonymous' for non-logged in users.

---

##### photoUrl: string | null [readonly]

The user's photo URL. `photoUrl` will be automatically generated users in workshop mode.`photoUrl` will also be automatically generated for the current user if they are not logged in. For other non-logged in users, this value will be null.

### BlendMode

```
type BlendMode = "PASS_THROUGH" | "NORMAL" | "DARKEN" | "MULTIPLY" | "LINEAR_BURN" | // "Plus darker" in Figma "COLOR_BURN" | "LIGHTEN" | "SCREEN" | "LINEAR_DODGE" | // "Plus lighter" in Figma "COLOR_DODGE" | "OVERLAY" | "SOFT_LIGHT" | "HARD_LIGHT" | "DIFFERENCE" | "EXCLUSION" | "HUE" | "SATURATION" | "COLOR" | "LUMINOSITY"
```

Blend mode describes how a color blends with what's underneath it. This property is typically set on a layer, fill or effect (e.g. blend mode of the shadow).

These blend modes are fairly standard and should match what you would find in other image processing tools.

### CodeLanguage

```
type CodeLanguage = { // A label for the code language. This label is displayed in the Figma UI. label: string // A specific code language. This value can be accessed and used in the plugin code. value: string}
```

### CodegenEvent

```
type CodegenEvent = { node: SceneNode language: string // typeof manifest.codegenLanguages[0].value}
```

### CodegenPreference

```
type CodegenPreference = | { itemType: 'unit' defaultScaleFactor: number scaledUnit: string default?: boolean // The languages that this preference applies to. // If omitted, will default to all languages. includedLanguages?: string[] } | { itemType: 'select' propertyName: string label: string options: { label: string; value: string; isDefault?: boolean }[] includedLanguages?: string[] } | { itemType: 'action' propertyName: string label: string includedLanguages?: string[] }
```

Codegen preferences let you define custom commands for your plugin that show up in Figma's UI. These commands can run plugin code, including the ability to open an iframe, and they allow users of the plugin to customize the codegen output.

#### "unit" preference

This configures whether the plugin supports a scaled unit (in addition to a pixel unit). This should only be defined once. This option will always appear at the top of the menu.

#### "select" preference

This is useful to provide a simple multiple-choice option for the user. This is useful for something like custom formatting options.

#### "action" preference

This is useful to open an iframe. When a user clicks on this item, the `figma.codegen.on('preferenceschange')` callback will get called.

### CodegenPreferencesEvent

```
type CodegenPreferencesEvent = { propertyName: string}
```

### CodegenResult

```
type CodegenResult = { // The title of the section title: string // The code of the section code: string // The language to use for syntax highlighting language: | 'TYPESCRIPT' | 'CPP' | 'RUBY' | 'CSS' | 'JAVASCRIPT' | 'HTML' | 'JSON' | 'GRAPHQL' | 'PYTHON' | 'GO' | 'SQL' | 'SWIFT' | 'KOTLIN' | 'RUST' | 'BASH' | 'PLAINTEXT'}
```

### CodeSyntaxPlatform

```
type CodeSyntaxPlatform = "WEB" | "ANDROID" | "iOS"
```

`code Syntax` is a variable field used for defining custom token names for up to three unique code platforms. There are no formatting or syntax restrictions enforced on the code syntax entries.

### ColorPalette

```
type ColorPalette = { [key: string]: string}
```

### ColorPalettes

```
type ColorPalettes { figJamBase: ColorPalette figJamBaseLight: ColorPalette}
```

There are currently two accessible properties on the `colors` object of type `ColorPalettes`: `figJamBase` and `figJamBaseLight`, both of type Color Palette.

These are official FigJam colors that can be found on this Figma Learn webpage.

**`figJamBase`**:

- Black `#1E1E1E`
- Gray `#B3B3B3`
- Red `#F24822`
- Orange `#FFA629`
- Yellow `#FFCD29`
- Green `#14AE5C`
- Blue `#0D99FF`
- Violet `#9747FF`
- White `#FFFFFF`

**`figJamBaseLight`**:

- Dark Gray `#757575`
- Light Gray `#E6E6E6`
- Light Red `#FFC7C2`
- Light Orange `#FCD19C`
- Light Yellow `#FFE8A3`
- Light Green `#AFF4C6`
- Light Blue `#BDE3FF`
- Light Violet `#E4CCFF`

Example of accessing colors on the palettes

```
const [color, setTextColor] = useSyncedState("theme", figma.constants.colors.figJamBase.gray)const [colorOne, setColorOne] = useSyncedState("themeOne", figma.constants.colors.figJamBaseLight.lightRed)
```

### ConnectorEndpoint

A connector endpoint represents one of two endpoints on a Connector Node.

```
// attached, magneted onto edge:{ // GUID of the node this attaches to endpointNodeId: string // Which side of the node it attaches to // Elbowed connectors may use all magnets besides CENTER // Straight connectors may use only CENTER or NONE magnets // The NONE magnet is automatically set when position is specified magnet: 'NONE' | 'AUTO' | 'TOP' | 'LEFT' | 'BOTTOM' | 'RIGHT' | 'CENTER'} |// attached, fixed position on node:{ // GUID of the node this attaches to endpointNodeId: string // position relative to the attached node to adhere the endpoint position: { x: number, y: number }} |// unattached, fixed to canvas:{ // location on the canvas to position unattached endpoint position: { x: number, y: number }}
```

There's an improved way to attach straight connectors to nodes in FigJam with a new CENTER magnet. Starting in 2024, straight connectors will only be able to attach to CENTER and NONE magnets. The magnets for elbowed connectors will remain unchanged.

Attaching a straight connector endpoint to another node's CENTER magnet

```
const shape = figma.createShapeWithText()const straightConnector = figma.createConnector()straightConnector.connectorLineType = 'STRAIGHT'// Setting a straight connector end endpoint magnet to shape's CENTER magnetstraightConnector.connectorEnd = { endpointNodeId: shape.id, magnet: 'CENTER',}
```

### ConnectorStrokeCap

```
type ConnectorStrokeCap = "NONE" | "ARROW_EQUILATERAL" | "ARROW_LINES" | "TRIANGLE_FILLED" | "DIAMOND_FILLED" | "CIRCLE_FILLED";
```

The possible values are:

- `"NONE"`: nothing is added to the end of the connector
- `"ARROW_EQUILATERAL"`: an arrow made up of an equilateral triangle is added to the end of the connector
- `"ARROW_LINES"`: an arrow made up of two lines is added to the end of the connector
- `"TRIANGLE_FILLED"`: a filled triangle is added to the end of the connector
- `"DIAMOND_FILLED"`: a filled diamond is added to the end of the connector
- `"CIRCLE_FILLED"`: a filled circle is added to the end of the connector

### Constraints

```
interface Constraints { readonly horizontal: ConstraintType readonly vertical: ConstraintType}
```

The resizing behavior of a layer when its containing frame is resized.

```
type ConstraintType = "MIN" | "CENTER" | "MAX" | "STRETCH" | "SCALE"
```

The possible values of the resizing behavior of a layer when its containing frame is resized. In the UI, these are referred to as:

- "MIN": Left or Top
- "MAX": Right or Bottom
- "CENTER": Center
- "STRETCH": Left & Right or Top & Bottom
- "SCALE": Scale

### ComponentProperties

```
type ComponentProperties = { [propertyName: string]: { type: ComponentPropertyType value: string | boolean preferredValues?: InstanceSwapPreferredValue[] readonly boundVariables?: { [field in VariableBindableComponentPropertyField]?: VariableAlias } }}type VariableBindableComponentPropertyField = "value"
```

A map of component properties that exist on an instance node. Each property in the map must have a type matching `Component Property Type`. A component property can optionally be bound to a `Variable`, in which case the `boundVariables` structure will be populated with a `Variable Alias` describing the variable controlling this property.

### ComponentPropertyDefinitions

```
type ComponentPropertyDefinitions = { [propertyName: string]: { type: ComponentPropertyType defaultValue: string | boolean variantOptions?: string[] preferredValues?: InstanceSwapPreferredValue[] readonly boundVariables?: { [field in VariableBindableComponentPropertyDefinitionField]?: VariableAlias } }}type VariableBindableComponentPropertyDefinitionField = "defaultValue"
```

A map of component property definitions that exist on a component or component set node. Each definition in the map must have a type matching `Component Property Type`. `defaultValue` represents the value that instances will initially have for that property. `'VARIANT'` properties also have `variantOptions`, a list of possible values for that variant property. `'INSTANCE_SWAP'` properties may optionally have a list of `Instance Swap Preferred Value`s. A component property can optionally be bound to a `Variable`, in which case the `boundVariables` structure will be populated with a `Variable Alias` describing the variable controlling this property.

### ComponentPropertyOptions

```
type ComponentPropertyOptions = { preferredValues?: InstanceSwapPreferredValue[] }
```

Additional options that can be specified when creating a new component property.

### ComponentPropertyType

```
type ComponentPropertyType = 'BOOLEAN' | 'TEXT' | 'INSTANCE_SWAP' | 'VARIANT'
```

The different types of component properties.

### DetachedInfo

```
type DetachedInfo = { type: 'local' componentId: string} | { type: 'library' componentKey: string}
```

Information about detached instances. If the node is detached from a local component (a component in the same file), `type` will show `local` and `componentId` will contain the ID of this component. If the node is detached from a library component, `type` will show `library`and `componentKey` will contain the key of this component.

`detachedInfo` will be present even if the component from which the node was detached has been deleted. It will also be present even if the user doesn't have access to the file containing that component.

### DevResource

Dev Resources are a new feature of Dev Mode, which allow you to add links to any layer within Figma.

!Image showing a dev resource

#### DevResource properties

##### name: string [readonly]

The name of the resource.

---

##### url: string [readonly]

The URL of the resource. This is considered the unique identifier of the resource.

---

##### inheritedNodeId?: string [readonly]

`inheritedNodeId` is a field only relevant to links on `INSTANCE` nodes. If `inheritedNodeId`is defined, the link is inherited from a main component or a component set. If you want to edit or delete the inherited link, you will need to go to the main node to do so. For example:

```
const devResource = { ..., inheritedNodeId: '1:2' }const node = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync(devResource.inheritedNodeId)await node.editDevResourceAsync(...)
```

---

##### nodeId: string

The ID of the node that this link is attached to.

#### Example usage

```
const node = figma.currentPage.selection[0]// Get related linkconst links = await node.getDevResourcesAsync()// Get related link from node and all of its childrenconst links = await node.getDevResourcesAsync({ includeChildren: true })// Add a related linkawait node.addDevResourceAsync('https://google.com')// Edit related linkawait node.editDevResourceAsync( 'https://google.com', { name: 'Hotels', url: 'https://hotels.com' })// Delete related linkawait node.deleteDevResourceAsync('https://hotels.com')
```

### DevStatus

```
type DevStatus = { type: "READY_FOR_DEV" | "COMPLETED", description?: string} | null
```

`DevStatus` represents whether or not a node has a particular handoff (or dev) status applied to it. A `null` value represents no status, and the `type` field represents the type of status the node has.

A node can have the statuses:

- `"READY_FOR_DEV"`, indicating that the node's contents are ready to be implemented by a developer
- `"COMPLETED"`, indicating that dev work for the design is done

Description is an optional field where the designer can add more information about the design and what has changed.

Note: currently, the plugin API does not reflect if a node has been changed since a status was set, but this can be seen in the app.

### DocumentChange

### ExportSettings

Figma has four types of exports: images, SVGs, PDFs, and REST API JSON.

```
type ExportSettings = | ExportSettingsImage | ExportSettingsSVG | ExportSettingsPDF | ExportSettingsREST
```

`ExportSettings` is used for the `export Settings` property and the `export Async` function.

#### Common properties

##### contentsOnly?: boolean [readonly]

Whether only the contents of the node are exported, or any overlapping layer in the same area. Defaults to `true`.

---

##### useAbsoluteBounds?: boolean [readonly]

Use the full dimensions of the node regardless of whether or not it is cropped or the space around it is empty. Use this to export text nodes without cropping. Defaults to `false`.

---

##### suffix?: string [readonly]

Suffix appended to the file name when exporting. Defaults to empty string.

---

##### colorProfile?: 'DOCUMENT' | 'SRGB' | 'DISPLAY_P3_V4' [readonly]

Color profile of the export.

Defaults to `'DOCUMENT'`

- `"DOCUMENT"`: Use the color profile of `document Color Profile`.
- `"SRGB"`: Use sRGB colors. This was the previous behavior of Figma before color management.
- `"DISPLAY_P3_V4"`: Use Display P3 colors.

---

#### ExportSettingsImage

##### format: 'JPG' | 'PNG' [readonly]

The string literal representing the export format. When reading `export Settings`, always check the `format` before reading other properties.

---

##### constraint?: [ExportSettingsConstraints](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/ExportSettings/#export-settings-constraints) [readonly]

Constraint on the image size when exporting.

```
interface ExportSettingsConstraints { type: "SCALE" | "WIDTH" | "HEIGHT" value: number}
```

Defaults to 100% of image size `{ type: "SCALE", value: 1 }`.

- `"SCALE"`: The size of the exported image is proportional to the size of the exported layer in Figma. A `value` of 1 means the export is 100% of the layer size.
- `"WIDTH"`: The exported image is scaled to have a fixed width of `value`.
- `"HEIGHT"`: The exported image is scaled to have a fixed height of `value`.

---

#### SVG export

`Export Settings SVG` controls SVG export settings. The `export Async` function supports an additional `Export Settings SVGString` type for exporting a node to an SVG string. Both types have the below common properties.

##### Common SVG export properties

##### svgOutlineText?: boolean [readonly]

Whether text elements are rendered as outlines (vector paths) or as `<text>` elements in SVGs. Defaults to `true`.

Rendering text elements as outlines guarantees that the text looks exactly the same in the SVG as it does in the browser/inside Figma.

Exporting as `<text>` allows text to be selectable inside SVGs and generally makes the SVG easier to read. However, this relies on the browser’s rendering engine which can vary between browsers and/or operating systems. As such, visual accuracy is not guaranteed as the result could look different than in Figma.

---

##### svgIdAttribute?: boolean [readonly]

Whether to include layer names as ID attributes in the SVG. This can be useful as a way to reference particular elements, but increases the size of the SVG. SVG features that require IDs to function, such as masks and gradients, will always have IDs. Defaults to `false`.

---

##### svgSimplifyStroke?: boolean [readonly]

Whether to export inside and outside strokes as an approximation of the original to simplify the output. Otherwise, it uses a more precise but more bloated masking technique. This is needed because SVGs only support center strokes. Defaults to `true`.

---

##### ExportSettingsSVG

##### format: 'SVG' [readonly]

The string literal "SVG" representing the export format. When reading `export Settings`, always check the `format` before reading other properties.

---

##### ExportSettingsSVGString

This is used only by `export Async`, and is the same as `ExportSettingsSVG` above, but exports the node as an `"<svg>...</svg>"` string rather than a Uint8Array.

##### format: 'SVG_STRING' [readonly]

The string literal "SVG_STRING" representing the export format.

---

#### ExportSettingsPDF

##### format: 'PDF' [readonly]

The string literal "PDF" representing the export format. When reading `export Settings`, always check the `format` before reading other properties.

---

#### ExportSettingsREST

This returns a JSON object in the shape of the response of the https://api.figma.com/v1/filesendpoint. For more information read about the API here.

##### format: 'JSON_REST_V1' [readonly]

Returns the equivalent REST API response of hitting the endpoint `https://api.figma.com/v1/files/:file_key/nodes?ids=:id`.

This is useful if you have existing code that uses the REST API that you would like to have work inside a plugin as well. It can also be significantly more perfomant if you need to serialize large groups of nodes and their children. Here is an example that logs the name of every child in a node using the REST API response:

Using the JSON_REST_V1 format

```
function visitChildren(child: Object) { console.log(child.name); if (child.children) { child.children.forEach(visitChildren); }}const response = await figma.currentPage.selection[0].exportAsync({ format: "JSON_REST_V1",});visitChildren(response.document);
```

For more information on the shape of the output of the 'JSON_REST_V1' format, see the filesdocumentation.

### FindAllCriteria

The `FindAllCriteria` defines an object that specifies the search criteria for the `node.find All With Criteria` method.

At least one of the following search criterias must be specified. If multiple are specified, only nodes that satisfy all criterias will be returned.

For more examples, see the documentation for `node.find All With Criteria`.

##### types?: T

If specified, the search will match nodes that have one of the given types.

```
// Find children of type text or frame.node.findAllWithCriteria({ types: ["TEXT", "FRAME"] })
```

---

##### pluginData?: { keys: string[] }

If specified, the search will match nodes that have `Plugin Data` stored for your plugin.

```
// Find children that have plugin data stored.node.findAllWithCriteria({ pluginData: {} })// Find children that have plugin data stored with keys// "a" or "b"node.findAllWithCriteria({ pluginData: { keys: ["a", "b"] }})
```

---

##### sharedPluginData?: { namespace: string; keys: string[] }

If specified, the search will match nodes that have `Shared Plugin Data` stored on the given `namespace` and `keys`.

```
// Find children that have shared plugin data// on the "foo" namespace.node.findAllWithCriteria({ sharedPluginData: { namespace: "foo" }})// Find children that have shared plugin data// on the "foo" namespace with keys "a" or "b"node.findAllWithCriteria({ sharedPluginData: { namespace: "foo", keys: ["a", "b"] }})
```

### FontName

```
interface Font { fontName: FontName}interface FontName { readonly family: string readonly style: string}
```

Describes a font used by a text node. For example, the default font is `{ family: "Inter", style: "Regular" }`.

### FontStyle

```
type FontStyle = "REGULAR" | "ITALIC"
```

The possible values are:

- `REGULAR`: The font is not italic.
- `ITALIC`: The font is italicized. This includes fonts marked as "oblique" in the font file as well.

### Guide

```
interface Guide { readonly axis: "X" | "Y" readonly offset: number}
```

Guides are either a horizontal (Y-axis) or vertical straight (X-axis) line. The offset determines its position relative to the node it is stored in (usually either the canvas or a frame).

### GridTrackSize

#### GridTrackSize

##### value?: number

Applicable only on FIXED grid tracks. The size of the track in pixels. Optional for `FLEX`tracks. If the setter for this value is called on a `FLEX` track, the track will be converted to a `FIXED` track.

---

##### type: 'FLEX' | 'FIXED'

The type of the grid track. `FLEX` indicates that the track will grow to fill the available space in the container (evenly divided among all flex tracks in the grid), while `FIXED` indicates that the track will have a fixed size.

### HandleMirroring

```
type HandleMirroring = "NONE" | "ANGLE" | "ANGLE_AND_LENGTH"
```

The possible values are:

- `"NONE"`: the two vector handles are independent from each other
- `"ANGLE"`: the two vector handles form a single tangent line, but the length of each handle is independent
- `"ANGLE_AND_LENGTH"`: the two vector handles form a single tangent line, equidistant on both sides of the vertex


### HyperlinkTarget

```
type HyperlinkTarget = { type: "URL" | "NODE" value: string}
```

An object representing hyperlink target. The possible values for `type` are:

- `"URL"`: value is a hyperlink URL. If the URL points to a valid node in the current document, the `HyperlinkTarget` is automatically converted to type `"NODE"`.
- `"NODE"`: value is the `id` of a node in the current document. Note that the node cannot be a sublayer of an instance.


### Image

This object is handle to an image stored in Figma.

A common misconception is that Figma has image layers. What we have instead is image fills `Image Paint`. In fact, dragging an image into Figma creates a rectangle with an image fill. This allows assigning images as strokes too, but it means that creating an image _on the canvas_ requires creating a rectangle (or other shape), following by adding an image fill to it.

New images can be created via `figma.create Image` from a `Uint8Array` containing the bytes of the image file. Existing images can be read via `figma.get Image By Hash`.

Figma supports PNG, JPEG, and GIF. Images can be up to 4096 pixels (4K) in width and height.

See this example of working with images.

#### Image

##### hash: string [readonly]

A unique hash of the contents of the image file.

---

##### `getBytesAsync(): Promise<Uint8Array>`

The contents of the corresponding image file. This returns a promise because the image may still need to be downloaded (images in Figma are loaded separately from the rest of the document).

---

##### getSizeAsync(): Promise<{ width: number; height: number }>

The width and height of the image in pixels. This returns a promise because the image may still need to be downloaded (images in Figma are loaded separately from the rest of the document).

The id of the `Paint Style` object that the `fills` property of this node is linked to.

If the manifest contains`"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, this property is read-only. Use `setFillStyleIdAsync` to update the style.



---

##### [cornerRadius](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-cornerradius/): number | [figma.mixed](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-mixed/)

---

##### topLeftRadius: number

---

##### topRightRadius: number

---

##### bottomLeftRadius: number

---

##### bottomRightRadius: number

You can set individual corner radius of each of the four corners of a rectangle node or frame-like node. Similar to `cornerRadius`, these value must be non-negative and can be fractional. If an edge length is less than twice the corner radius, the corner radius for each vertex of the edge will be clamped to half the edge length.

Setting `cornerRadius` sets the property for all four corners. Setting these corners to different values makes `cornerRadius` return `mixed`.

### LayoutGrid

Figma has two types of grids: uniform grids and regular (row or column) based grids.

```
type LayoutGrid = RowsColsLayoutGrid | GridLayoutGrid
```

#### Common properties

##### visible?: boolean [readonly]

### MaskType

```
type MaskType = "ALPHA" | "VECTOR" | "LUMINANCE"
```

Mask type defines what type of masking a node should use if it is a mask.

The possible values are:

- `"ALPHA"`: the mask node's alpha channel will be used to determine the opacity of each pixel in the masked result.
- `"VECTOR"`: if the mask node has visible fill paints, every pixel inside the node's fill regions will be fully visible in the masked result. If the mask has visible stroke paints, every pixel inside the node's stroke regions will be fully visible in the masked result.
- `"LUMINANCE"`: the luminance value of each pixel of the mask node will be used to determine the opacity of that pixel in the masked result.

### Measurement

Measurements can be added between nodes in Dev Mode to highlight distances.

Measurements can only be added between the following node types: Component Node, Component Set Node, Ellipse Node, Frame Node, Instance Node, Line Node, Polygon Node, Rectangle Node, Star Node, Text Node, Vector Node.

You can read, add, edit and remove measurements by using the measurement methods on a Page Node.

The value of the measurement displayed can be overridden with the `freeText` field.

#### Measurement properties

```
interface Measurement { id: string start: { node: SceneNode; side: MeasurementSide } end: { node: SceneNode; side: MeasurementSide } offset: MeasurementOffset freeText: string}
```

See Measurement Side and Measurement Offset for supported values.

#### Page node properties

##### getMeasurements(): [Measurement](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Measurement/)[]

#### Example usage

```
const [frame1, frame2] = figma.currentPage.children// Add a measurementconst measurement1 = figma.currentPage.addMeasurement( { node: frame1, side: 'RIGHT' }, { node: frame2, side: 'LEFT' } )// Edit the measurement's offset to be at the bottom of frame1 on the canvasconst editedMeasurement1 = figma.currentPage.editMeasurement( measurement1.id, { offset: { type: 'INNER', relative: 1 } } )// Add a measurement with an offset of 10 above frame2 on the canvasconst measurement2 = figma.currentPage.addMeasurement( { node: frame2, side: 'LEFT' }, { node: frame1, side: 'RIGHT' }, { offset: { type: 'OUTER', fixed: -10 } } )// Override the value shown in the measurement to show '100%'const editedMeasurement2 = figma.currentPage.editMeasurement( measurement2.id, { freeText: '100%' } )// Delete a measurementfigma.currentPage.deleteMeasurement(measurement2.id)
```

### MeasurementOffset

```
type MeasurementOffset = | { type: 'INNER'; relative: number } | { type: 'OUTER'; fixed: number }
```

The offset of a Measurement. The offset field is relative to the start node’s center. It can either be:

- type `'INNER'` where the field `relative` is between -1 and 1, indicating where along the node’s edge the measurement starts.
- type `'OUTER'` where the node field `fixed` is the space between the measurement and the edge of the start node. The sign of the number determines which side it sticks out of. Its value must be non-zero (use type `'INNER'` for an offset of `0`).

### MeasurementSide

```
type MeasurementSide = 'TOP' | 'RIGHT' | 'BOTTOM' | 'LEFT'
```

The side of a node a Measurement is attached to.

### MediaData

The metadata for a Media node in FigJam

#### MediaData

##### hash: string

A unique hash of the contents of the media node

```

### OverflowDirection

```
type OverflowDirection = "NONE" | "HORIZONTAL" | "VERTICAL" | "BOTH"
```

The possible values are:

- `"NONE"`: the frame does not _explicitly_ scroll
- `"HORIZONTAL"`: the frame can scroll in the horizontal direction if its content exceeds the frame's bounds horizontally
- `"VERTICAL"`: the frame can in the vertical direction if its content exceeds the frame's bounds vertically
- `"BOTH"`: the frame can scroll in either direction if the content exceeds the frame's bounds

Note that top-level frames (parented directly under the canvas) can still scroll even when `OverflowDirection` is `NONE`.

### Overlay

```
type OverlayBackground = { readonly type: "NONE" } | { readonly type: "SOLID_COLOR", readonly color: RGBA }
```

An overlay either has no background or a single colored background (usually transparent).

### PublishStatus

```
type PublishStatus = "UNPUBLISHED" | "CURRENT" | "CHANGED"
```

Describes the status of elements that could be published to the team library, namely styles and components.

The possible values are:

- `"UNPUBLISHED"`: the element is not published to the team library
- `"CURRENT"`: the element is published and the published version matches the local version
- `"CHANGED"`: the element is published, but has local changes

### Reaction

```
type Reaction = { action?: Action, actions?: Action[], trigger: Trigger | null }
```

A prototyping `Reaction` describes interactivity in prototypes. It contains a list of `Action`objects ("what happens?") and a `Trigger` ("how do you make it happen?").

> Note: The `action` field is now deprecated and replaced by the `actions` field in order to allow for multiple `Actions` on a `Reaction`.

When setting reactions, each `Reaction` must contain both a `Trigger` and a non-empty list of `Action` objects.

### Rect

```
interface Rect { readonly x: number readonly y: number readonly width: number readonly height: number}
```

### RGB/RGBA

```
interface RGBA { // "Red" readonly r: number // "Green" readonly g: number // "Blue" readonly b: number // "Alpha" or "opacity" readonly a: number}
```

Represents a full Figma color value. These values are from 0 to 1. For example black is `{r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1}` and white is `{r: 1, g: 1, b: 1, a: 1}`.

```
interface RGB { readonly r: number readonly g: number readonly b: number}
```

Represents a color just like RGBA but without an alpha value. This is only used for `Solid Paint`. Colors normally have an alpha value but all paints have an opacity value so alpha was redundant for `Solid Paint`.

Figma supports color management. All colors are specified in the same color space which will be the color profile of the document, `document Color Profile`.

### RunEvent

```
interface RunEvent { parameters?: ParameterValues command: string}
```

### SlideTransition

A `SlideTransition` is a transition, or animation, that is played when navigating between slides in a Figma Slides presentation.

To read the current slide transition:

```
const slideTransition = slideNode.getSlideTransition()
```

To set the slide transition:

```
slideNode.setSlideTransition(slideTransition)
```

If you use the trigger type ON_CLICK, the delay parameter will be ignored and set to 0.

To clear a slide transition, you can set its transition type to NONE:

```
slideNode.setSlideTransition({ style: 'NONE', duration: 0.3, curve: 'EASE_IN', timing: { type: 'ON_CLICK' } })
```

If you want to update the slide transition for every slide in the grid, like the button in UI that says “Apply to all slides”, you can loop through each slide in the grid.

```
figma.getSlideGrid().flat().forEach(slide => slide.setSlideTransition(transition))
```

#### Slide Transition properties

##### style: 'NONE' | 'DISSOLVE' | 'SLIDE_FROM_LEFT' | 'SLIDE_FROM_RIGHT' | 'SLIDE_FROM_BOTTOM' | 'SLIDE_FROM_TOP' | 'PUSH_FROM_LEFT' | 'PUSH_FROM_RIGHT' | 'PUSH_FROM_BOTTOM' | 'PUSH_FROM_TOP' | 'MOVE_FROM_LEFT' | 'MOVE_FROM_RIGHT' | 'MOVE_FROM_TOP' | 'MOVE_FROM_BOTTOM' | 'SLIDE_OUT_TO_LEFT' | 'SLIDE_OUT_TO_RIGHT' | 'SLIDE_OUT_TO_TOP' | 'SLIDE_OUT_TO_BOTTOM' | 'MOVE_OUT_TO_LEFT' | 'MOVE_OUT_TO_RIGHT' | 'MOVE_OUT_TO_TOP' | 'MOVE_OUT_TO_BOTTOM' | 'SMART_ANIMATE' [readonly]

The type of slide transition.

---

##### duration: number [readonly]

The duration of the slide transition, in seconds.

---

##### curve: 'EASE_IN' | 'EASE_OUT' | 'EASE_IN_AND_OUT' | 'LINEAR' | 'GENTLE' | 'QUICK' | 'BOUNCY' | 'SLOW' [readonly]

The easing of the slide transition.

---

##### timing: { type: 'ON_CLICK' | 'AFTER_DELAY'; delay: number } [readonly]

The timing of the slide transition.

### SlidesViewChangeEvent

This event is triggered when the user toggles between grid view and single slide view in Figma Slides.

```
interface SlidesViewChangeEvent { view: 'GRID' | 'SINGLE_SLIDE'}
```

To read the current view, use the `figma.viewport.slides View` property.

### StrokeCap

```
type StrokeCap = "NONE" |"ROUND" |"SQUARE" |"ARROW_LINES" |"ARROW_EQUILATERAL" |"DIAMOND_FILLED" |"TRIANGLE_FILLED" |"CIRCLE_FILLED"
```

The possible values are:

- `"NONE"`: nothing is added to the end of the stroke
- `"ROUND"`: a semi-circle is added to the end of the stroke
- `"SQUARE"`: a square is added to the end of the stroke
- `"ARROW_LINES"`: an arrow made up of two lines is added to the end of the stroke
- `"ARROW_EQUILATERAL"`: an arrow made up of an equilateral triangle pointing outwards is added to the end of the stroke
- `"DIAMOND_FILLED"`: a filled diamond is added to the end of the stroke
- `"TRIANGLE_FILLED"`: an arrow made up of an equilateral triangle pointing inwards is added to the end of the stroke
- `"CIRCLE_FILLED"`: a filled circle is added to the end of the stroke

### StrokeJoin

```
type StrokeJoin = "MITER" | "BEVEL" | "ROUND"
```

The possible values are:

- `"MITER"`: the junction between two strokes will be sharp and pointy, unless the angle is below the "Miter Angle" in which case it the pointy bit will be cut off to "BEVEL" (this is necessary because extremely sharp angles would have an extremely long sharp edge)
- `"BEVEL"`: the sharp bit at the corner of the join is cut off
- `"ROUND"`: the corner is rounded

#### Samples

##### Example: Text node that consumes a style with two overrides

Imagine you have a Figma text node with a single textStyle, with the text "**hello** _world_".

- The font in the style is a Regular weight, and non-italicized.
- A user has bolded "hello", and italicized "world", but left the space in between untouched.

```
// Notice that the textStyleId is uniform across the selection,// which we can determine using either getStyledTextSegments()// or getRangeTextStyleId()text.getRangeTextStyleId(0, text.characters.length)// Output: "someStyleId" (non-mixed)text.getStyledTextSegments(['textStyleOverrides', 'textStyleId'])// Output:[ { "characters": "hello", "start": 0, "end": 5, "textStyleOverrides": [ "SEMANTIC_WEIGHT" // indicates that the font weight differs from the original style ], textStyleId: "someStyleId" }, { "characters": " ", "start": 5, "end": 6, "textStyleOverrides": [], // indicates that this segment follows the original style textStyleId: "someStyleId" }, { "characters": "world", "start": 6, "end": 11, "textStyleOverrides": [ "SEMANTIC_ITALIC" // indicates that the italics differ from the original style ], textStyleId: "someStyleId" }]// Next, to find out what was overridden, we can use getStyledTextSegments(['fontWeight', 'fontName'])text.getStyledTextSegments(['fontWeight', 'fontName'])// Output:[ { "characters": "hello", "start": 0, "end": 5, "fontName": { "family": "Inter", "style": "Bold" }, "fontWeight": 700 }, { "characters": " ", "start": 5, "end": 6, "fontName": { "family": "Inter", "style": "Regular" }, "fontWeight": 400 }, { "characters": "world", "start": 6, "end": 11, "fontName": { "family": "Inter", "style": "Italic" }, "fontWeight": 400 }]
```

### TextSublayer

Text sublayer nodes are pared-back versions of text nodes: they have most text properties (except `textAlignVertical` and `textAutoResize`, which are not editable on these nodes' text sublayers), as well as `fills`. They aren't resizable or repositionable.

You set text content as you would for any other text node (e.g. `sticky.text.characters = 'some text'`). As with all other text operations in Figma, you'll need to ensure fonts are loaded.

#### Basic traits

### Transition

```
interface SimpleTransition { readonly type: "DISSOLVE" | "SMART_ANIMATE" | "SCROLL_ANIMATE" readonly easing: Easing readonly duration: number}interface DirectionalTransition { readonly type: "MOVE_IN" | "MOVE_OUT" | "PUSH" | "SLIDE_IN" | "SLIDE_OUT" readonly direction: "LEFT" | "RIGHT" | "TOP" | "BOTTOM" readonly matchLayers: boolean readonly easing: Easing readonly duration: number}type Transition = SimpleTransition | DirectionalTransitioninterface Easing { readonly type: "EASE_IN" | "EASE_OUT" | "EASE_IN_AND_OUT" | "LINEAR" | "EASE_IN_BACK" | "EASE_OUT_BACK" | "EASE_IN_AND_OUT_BACK" | "CUSTOM_CUBIC_BEZIER" | "GENTLE" | "QUICK" | "BOUNCY" | "SLOW" | "CUSTOM_SPRING" readonly easingFunctionCubicBezier?: { x1: number, y1: number, x2: number, y2: number } readonly easingFunctionSpring?: { mass: number, stiffness: number, damping: number, initialVelocity: number }}
```

A prototyping `Transition` describes an animation used when navigating in a prototype.

When the transition `type` is `"SMART_ANIMATE"` or when `matchLayers` is `true`, then the transition will be performed using smart animate, which attempts to match corresponding layers an interpolate other properties during the animation.

When the easing `type` is `"CUSTOM_CUBIC_BEZIER"`, then `easingFunctionCubicBezier`will describe the points that define the cubic bezier easing curve. The values `x1, y1, x2, y2` are the same as shown in the UI.

When the easing `type` is `"CUSTOM_SPRING"`, then `easingFunctionSpring` will describe parameters for the spring formula. These parameters are `mass`, `stiffness` and `damping`.

### Transform

```
type Transform = [ [number, number, number], [number, number, number]]
```

A transformation matrix is standard way in computer graphics to represent translation and rotation. These are the top two rows of a 3x3 matrix. The bottom row of the matrix is assumed to be [0, 0, 1]. This is known as an affine transform and is enough to represent translation, rotation, and skew.

The identity transform is `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]`.

A translation matrix will typically look like:

```
[[1, 0, tx], [0, 1, ty]]
```

and a rotation matrix will typically look like:

```
[[cos(angle), sin(angle), 0], [-sin(angle), cos(angle), 0]]
```

Another way to think about this transform is as three vectors:

- The x axis (t[0][0], t[1][0])
- The y axis (t[0][1], t[1][1])
- The translation offset (t[0][2], t[1][2])

The most common usage of the `Transform` matrix is the `relative Transform` property. This particular usage of the matrix has a few additional restrictions. The translation offset can take on any value but we do enforce that the axis vectors are unit vectors (i.e. have length 1). The axes are not required to be at 90° angles to each other. More details in the `relative Transform` properties page.

### Trigger

```
type Trigger = { readonly type: "ON_CLICK" | "ON_HOVER" | "ON_PRESS" | "ON_DRAG", "ON_MEDIA_END" } | { readonly type: "AFTER_TIMEOUT", readonly timeout: number } | { readonly type: "MOUSE_UP" | "MOUSE_DOWN", readonly delay: number, } | { readonly type: "MOUSE_ENTER" | "MOUSE_LEAVE" readonly delay: number, readonly deprecatedVersion: boolean } | { readonly type: "ON_KEY_DOWN", readonly device: "KEYBOARD" | "XBOX_ONE" | "PS4" | "SWITCH_PRO" | "UNKNOWN_CONTROLLER", readonly keyCodes: ReadonlyArray<number>, } | { readonly type: "ON_MEDIA_HIT", readonly mediaHitTime: number }
```

A prototyping `Trigger` describes the user input needed to cause an interaction to happen.

The `"ON_HOVER"` and `"ON_PRESS"` trigger types revert the navigation when the trigger is finished. On the other hand, `"MOUSE_ENTER"`, `"MOUSE_LEAVE"`, `"MOUSE_UP"` and `"MOUSE_DOWN"` are permanent, one-way navigation.

The `delay` parameter requires the trigger to be held for a certain duration of time before the action occurs.

Both `timeout` and `delay` are stored in milliseconds.

The `"ON_MEDIA_HIT"` and `"ON_MEDIA_END"` trigger types can only trigger from a video. They fire when a video reaches a certain time or ends. The `timestamp` parameter is stored in seconds.

### User

The `User` object contains details about a user.

##### id: string | null [readonly]

The user's id. `id` will be automatically generated users in workshop mode. `id` will also be automatically generated for the current user if they are not logged in. For other non-logged in users, this value will be null.

---

##### name: string [readonly]

The user's name. `name` will be 'Anonymous' for non-logged in users.

---

##### photoUrl: string | null [readonly]

---

##### color: string [readonly]

The current user's multiplayer color. This will match the color of their dot stamps and cursor.

---

##### sessionId: number [readonly]

The user's session id. This is guaranteed to be unique among active users. For example, if a user with the same `id` opens a file in different tabs, each `User` will have a unique `sessionId`.


### Vector

```
interface Vector { readonly x: number readonly y: number}
```

This type represents a 2D vector. This same type is used to represent absolute points, relative offsets, and rectangular sizes.

### Variables
#### Variable properties

A `Variable` is a single design token that defines values for each of the modes in its `Variable Collection`. These values can be applied to various kinds of design properties and prototyping actions, enabling design token functionality and advanced prototyping flows.

##### Signature

###### [hiddenFromPublishing](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/Variable-hiddenfrompublishing/): boolean

##### Remarks

If the parent `Variable Collection` is marked as `hiddenFromPublishing`, then this variable will also be hidden from publishing via the UI. `hiddenFromPublishing` is independently toggled for a variable and collection, however both must be true for a given variable to be publishable.

#### resolveForConsumer

Retrieves the resolved value for this variable if it was bound to `consumer`.

##### Signature

##### [resolveForConsumer](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/Variable-resolveforconsumer/)(consumer: [SceneNode](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/nodes/#scene-node)): { value: [VariableValue](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/VariableValue/); resolvedType: [VariableResolvedDataType](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/VariableResolvedDataType/) }

##### Remarks

The value that a variable resolves to depends on the following:

- The node consuming the variable and which of the collection's modes is currently selected in the node
- The variable's value for the selected mode
- If that value is an alias, then the resolved value is determined using the selected modes of each collection in the alias chain

It is not possible to statically determine the resolved value of a variable when there are multiple modes involved (either in the variable itself or in any variables in the alias chain).

The consuming node can have any combination of explicit or inherited variable modes per collection assigned to it.

Here are some examples illustrating how variables can resolve to different values depending on the consuming node. These examples do not work if the current file is on the Starter plan, which is limited to a single mode.

For a variable in a collection with two modes, it can resolve to up to two different values:

Simple variable value resolution without aliasing

```
// Create a collection with two modes and a variable with a different// float value for each modeconst collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("Collection")const mode1Id = collection.modes[0].modeIdconst mode2Id = collection.addMode('Mode 2')const variable = figma.variables.createVariable( "My Variable", collection, 'FLOAT')variable.setValueForMode(mode1Id, 1)variable.setValueForMode(mode2Id, 2)const frame = figma.createFrame()frame.setExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection, mode1Id)// Output: {value: 1, resolvedType: 'FLOAT'}console.log(variable.resolveForConsumer(frame))frame.setExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection, mode2Id)// Output: {value: 2, resolvedType: 'FLOAT'}console.log(variable.resolveForConsumer(frame))
```

For a variable in a collection with two modes with each value aliasing to different variables in another collection with two modes, it can resolve to up to four different values.

Variable value resolution with aliasing

```
// Create two collections:// 1. A collection with two modes and two float variables// 2. A collection with two modes and a variable aliasing to// different variables in the first collectionconst collection1 = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("Collection 1")const collection1Mode1Id = collection1.modes[0].modeIdconst collection1Mode2Id = collection1.addMode('Mode 2')const collection1Var1 = figma.variables.createVariable( "Variable 1", collection1, 'FLOAT')collection1Var1.setValueForMode(collection1Mode1Id, 1)collection1Var1.setValueForMode(collection1Mode2Id, 2)const collection1Var2 = figma.variables.createVariable( "Variable 2", collection1, 'FLOAT')collection1Var2.setValueForMode(collection1Mode1Id, 3)collection1Var2.setValueForMode(collection1Mode2Id, 4)const collection2 = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("Collection 2")const collection2Mode1Id = collection2.modes[0].modeIdconst collection2Mode2Id = collection2.addMode('Mode 2')const collection2Var = figma.variables.createVariable( "Variable 1", collection2, 'FLOAT')collection2Var.setValueForMode( collection2Mode1Id, figma.variables.createVariableAlias(collection1Var1))collection2Var.setValueForMode( collection2Mode2Id, figma.variables.createVariableAlias(collection1Var2))const frame = figma.createFrame()frame.setExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection1, collection1Mode1Id)frame.setExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection2, collection2Mode1Id)// Output: {value: 1, resolvedType: 'FLOAT'}console.log(collection2Var.resolveForConsumer(frame))frame.setExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection1, collection1Mode2Id)frame.setExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection2, collection2Mode1Id)// Output: {value: 2, resolvedType: 'FLOAT'}console.log(collection2Var.resolveForConsumer(frame))frame.setExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection1, collection1Mode1Id)frame.setExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection2, collection2Mode2Id)// Output: {value: 3, resolvedType: 'FLOAT'}console.log(collection2Var.resolveForConsumer(frame))frame.setExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection1, collection1Mode2Id)frame.setExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection2, collection2Mode2Id)// Output: {value: 4, resolvedType: 'FLOAT'}console.log(collection2Var.resolveForConsumer(frame))
```

#### scopes

An array of scopes in the UI where this variable is shown. Setting this property will show/hide this variable in the variable picker UI for different fields.

##### Signature

###### [scopes](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/Variable-scopes/): Array<[VariableScope](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/VariableScope/)>

##### Remarks

Setting scopes for a variable does not prevent that variable from being bound in other scopes (for example, via the Plugin API). This only limits the variables that are shown in pickers within the Figma UI.

#### setVariableCodeSyntax

Add or modify a platform definition on `code Syntax`. Acceptable platforms are `'WEB'`, `'ANDROID'`, and `'iOS'`.

##### Signature

###### [setVariableCodeSyntax](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/Variable-setvariablecodesyntax/)(platform: [CodeSyntaxPlatform](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/CodeSyntaxPlatform/#code-syntax-platform), value: string): void

##### Remarks

Here’s an example of adding code syntax definitions to a variable:

```
const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection( 'Example Collection' ) const variable = figma.variables.createVariable( 'ExampleVariableName', collection, 'STRING' ) variable.setVariableCodeSyntax('WEB', 'example-variable-name') variable.setVariableCodeSyntax('ANDROID', 'exampleVariableName') variable.setVariableCodeSyntax('iOS', 'exampleVariableName') // Output: // { // WEB: 'example-variable-name', // ANDROID: 'exampleVariableName', // iOS: 'exampleVariableName' // } console.log(variable.codeSyntax)
```

#### VariableCollection

##### Variable Collection properties

A `Variable collection` is a grouping of related `Variable` objects each with the same modes.

Every `Variable` in a collection define values for each of its collection's modes, and can be published to create a tokenized design system. Read more about variables in the Guide to variables.

- `"BOOLEAN"` variables can be assigned to `true` or `false`
- `"COLOR"` variables can be assigned to `RGB` values
- `"FLOAT"` variables can be assigned to `number` values
- `"STRING"` variables can be assigned to `string` values

Since a variable can be assigned to a `Variable Alias` for any given mode, this type refers to the type of the fully resolved value (after following all aliases).

#### VariableScope

```
type VariableScope = "ALL_SCOPES" | "TEXT_CONTENT" | "CORNER_RADIUS" | "WIDTH_HEIGHT" | "GAP" | "ALL_FILLS" | "FRAME_FILL" | "SHAPE_FILL" | "TEXT_FILL" | "STROKE_COLOR" | "EFFECT_COLOR" | "STROKE_FLOAT" | "EFFECT_FLOAT" | "OPACITY" | "FONT_FAMILY" | "FONT_STYLE" | "FONT_WEIGHT" | "FONT_SIZE" | "LINE_HEIGHT" | "LETTER_SPACING" | "PARAGRAPH_SPACING" | "PARAGRAPH_INDENT"
```

Scopes allow a variable to be shown or hidden in the variable picker for various fields. This is useful to help declutter the Figma UI if you have a large number of variables. Scopes are currently supported for `FLOAT`, `STRING` and `COLOR` variables.

`ALL_SCOPES` is a special scope that means that the variable is shown in the picker for all fields. If `ALL_SCOPES` is set, no additional scopes can be set.

`ALL_FILLS` is a special scope that means that the variable is available in the variable picker for all color fill fields. If `ALL_FILLS` is set, no additional fill scopes can be set.

Valid scopes for `FLOAT` variables are: `ALL_SCOPES`, `TEXT_CONTENT`, `CORNER_RADIUS`, `WIDTH_HEIGHT`, `GAP`, `OPACITY`, `STROKE_FLOAT`, `EFFECT_FLOAT`, `FONT_WEIGHT`, `FONT_SIZE`, `LINE_HEIGHT`, `LETTER_SPACING`, `PARAGRAPH_SPACING`, and `PARAGRAPH_INDENT`.

Valid scopes for `COLOR` variables are: `ALL_SCOPES`, `ALL_FILLS`, `FRAME_FILL`, `SHAPE_FILL`, `TEXT_FILL`, `STROKE_COLOR`, and `EFFECT_COLOR`.

Valid scopes for `STRING` variables are: `ALL_SCOPES`, `TEXT_CONTENT`, `FONT_FAMILY`, `FONT_STYLE`.

#### VariableValue

```
type VariableValue = string | number | boolean | RGB | RGBA | VariableAlias
```

##### Variable Alias

Created via `figma.variables.createVariableBinding()`. Used to alias variables to other variables. Each `VariableValue` has at least one corresponding `Variable Resolved Data Type`.

#### setBoundVariable

Binds the provided `field` on this node to the given variable. Please see the Working with Variables guide for how to get and set variable bindings.

If `null` is provided as the variable, the given `field` will be unbound from any variables.

##### Signature

### VectorPath

The `VectorPath` API is the recommended way to change the geometry of a vector object. While vector networks are more powerful, they are significantly more complicated and very easy to get wrong. Paths are usually sufficient and much easier to work with. Creating a vector path looks like this:

```
// Set the geometry to a trianglenode.vectorPaths = [{ windingRule: "EVENODD", data: "M 0 100 L 100 100 L 50 0 Z",}]
```

#### VectorPath

##### [windingRule](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/VectorPath-windingrule/): [WindingRule](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/VectorPath-windingrule/#winding-rule) | 'NONE' [readonly]

The winding rule for the path (same as in SVGs). This determines whether a given point in space is inside or outside the path.



---

##### [data](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/VectorPath-data/): string [readonly]

A series of path commands that encodes how to draw the path.



#### VectorPaths

Vector nodes can be composed of multiple VectorPath(s).

```
type VectorPaths = ReadonlyArray<VectorPath>
```

#### data

A series of path commands that encodes how to draw the path.

##### Signature

###### [data](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/VectorPath-data/): string [readonly]

##### Remarks

Figma supports a subset of the SVG path format. Path commands must be joined into a single string in order separated by a single space. Here are the path commands we support:

- `M x y`: The absolute "move to" command.
- `L x y`: The absolute "line to" command.
- `Q x0 y0 x y`: The absolute "quadratic spline to" command. _Note_ that while Figma supports this as input, we will never generate this ourselves. All quadratic splines are converted to cubic splines internally.
- `C x0 y0 x1 y1 x y`: The absolute "cubic spline to" command.
- `Z`: The "close path" command.

#### windingRule

The winding rule for the path (same as in SVGs). This determines whether a given point in space is inside or outside the path.

##### Signature

###### [windingRule](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/VectorPath-windingrule/): [WindingRule](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/VectorPath-windingrule/#winding-rule) | 'NONE' [readonly]

##### Remarks

```
type WindingRule = "NONZERO" | "EVENODD"
```

Winding rules work off a concept called the winding number, which tells you for a given point how many times the path winds around that point. This is described in much more detail here. This field can have three possible values:

- `"NONZERO"`: The point is considered inside the path if the winding number is NONZERO.
- `"EVENODD"`: The point is considered inside the path if the winding number is odd.
- `"NONE"`: An open path won’t have a fill.

### VectorNetwork

The `VectorNetwork` API is the advanced way to change the geometry of an object. For the simple (and recommended) way to specify geometry, please look at the `Vector Path`definition instead.

Vector networks enable Figma to provide better ways of manipulating stroke geometry than other apps. They are essentially a superset of paths; a vector network can represent everything paths can represent while paths can’t represent everything a vector network represents.

While paths can only represent chains of segments, vector networks can represent whole graphs of segments. This means more than two segments can connect together at a point. This is more natural to edit (connect anything to anything else) and is useful for preserving caps and joins as the graph is edited.

Vector networks come in three parts: an array of vertices, an array of segments that index into the array of vertices, and an array of regions that index into the array of segments.

#### Example

Here's the same geometry as the triangle in the path example `M 0 100 L 100 100 L 50 0 Z`, in vector network representation:

```
node.vectorNetwork = { // The vertices of the triangle vertices: [ { x: 0, y: 100 }, { x: 100, y: 100 }, { x: 50, y: 0 }, ], // The edges of the triangle. 'start' and 'end' refer to indices in the vertices array. segments: [ { start: 0, tangentStart: { x: 0, y: 0 }, // optional end: 1, tangentEnd: { x: 0, y: 0 }, // optional }, { start: 1, end: 2, }, { start: 2, end: 0, }, ], // The loop that forms the triangle. Each loop is a // sequence of indices into the segments array. regions: [ { windingRule: "NONZERO", loops: [[0, 1, 2]] } ],}
```

#### VectorNetwork

##### vertices: ReadonlyArray<[VectorVertex](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/VectorNetwork/#vector-vertex)> [readonly]

Vertices are points in the graph.

---

##### segments: ReadonlyArray<[VectorSegment](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/VectorNetwork/#vector-segment)> [readonly]

Segments connect vertices.

---

##### regions?: ReadonlyArray<[VectorRegion](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/VectorNetwork/#vector-region)> [readonly]

Regions are defined by segments and specify that an area is to be filled. Defaults to [].

---

#### VectorVertex

Each vertex is a point in the graph, defined by its position.

##### x: number [readonly]

x position of the vertex relative to the position of the node.

---

##### y: number [readonly]

y position of the vertex relative to the position of the node.

---

##### strokeCap?: [StrokeCap](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/StrokeCap/) [readonly]

Appearance of the end of a stroke. Defaults to the node's property if left unspecified.

---

##### strokeJoin?: [StrokeJoin](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/StrokeJoin/) [readonly]

Appearance of the join between two segments. Defaults to the node's property if left unspecified.

---

##### cornerRadius?: number [readonly]

Corner radius at this vertex. Defaults to the node's property if left unspecified.

---

##### handleMirroring?: [HandleMirroring](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/HandleMirroring/) [readonly]

How two curve handles behave relative to one another. Defaults to the node's property if left unspecified.

---

#### VectorSegment

Each segment has a start and an end vertex, referenced by index.

Segments represent both line segments and cubic spline segments. A line segment is just a cubic spline segment where both handles have a tangent of `{x: 0, y: 0}`, which are also the default values of `tangentStart` and `tangentEnd`.

As long as the stroke weight is non-zero, a stroke will appear for every segment in the vector network. _Note_ that it does not matter which is the start handle and which is the end handle. Segments are non-directional graph edges.

Each segment must refer to a valid vertex index in both `start` and `end`.

##### start: number [readonly]

The index of the vertex that starts this segment.

---

##### end: number [readonly]

The index of the vertex that ends this segment.

---

##### tangentStart?: [Vector](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Vector/) [readonly]

The tangent on the start side of this segment. Defaults to `{ x: 0, y: 0 }`

---

##### tangentEnd?: [Vector](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/Vector/) [readonly]

The tangent on the end side of this segment. Defaults to `{ x: 0, y: 0 }`

---

#### VectorRegion

Each region is essentially the same data as a `Vector Path`; it has a winding rule and one or more loops. A region such as the fill of the letter "o" needs two loops, one for the outside and one for the inside. Each loop is an array of segment indices that specify the segments involved in the loop consecutively as they are encountered around the edge of the loop. Which segment the loop starts on is not important.

A vector network does not need to have any regions. If it does not, all enclosed space, if any, is filled.

If the vector network does have regions, then each region must contain at least one loop, each loop must contain at least one segment, and every segment in every loop must refer to a valid segment index. Additionally, the segments in each loop must form a connected continuous chain. I.e. they should be connected such that you can draw all segments of the loop, in the order they are defined, without lifting the pen and without tracing a segment more times than it is defined in the loop. Forks and gaps are not allowed. However, the order of the `start` and `end` points in the segments do not matter, i.e. the `end` vertex of one segment does not need to match the `start` vertex of the next segment in the loop, but can instead match the `end` vertex of that segment.

A region also may contain an array of `fills`, or a `fillStyleId` which uses the same syntax as the corresponding fields on nodes: (`fills`, `fill Style Id`).

##### windingRule: [WindingRule](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/VectorPath-windingrule/#winding-rule) [readonly]

Winding rule for this region.

### Video

This object is handle to a video stored in Figma.

Like images, instead of video layers, Figma has video fills `Video Paint`. In fact, dragging a video into Figma creates a rectangle with an video fill. Creating a video _on the canvas_requires creating a rectangle (or other shape), following by adding a video fill to it.

New videos can be created via `figma.create Video Async` from a `Uint8Array` containing the bytes of the video file.

Figma supports MP4, MOV, and WebM files. Videos can be up to 100 MB in size. Video can only be added to files in a paid Education, Professional, and Organization team. Plugins running on files in free Starter teams can edit existing video in a file but not upload video to it.

#### Video

##### hash: string [readonly]

A unique hash of the contents of the video file.

### BaseStyle

Styles in Figma define reusable colors, text properties, effects, or layout grids that can be applied to nodes.

Here are the different types of styles, each with their own set of properties:

- Paint Style
- Text Style
- Effect Style
- Grid Style

In the type declarations, each style type is represented with an interface. The most general, `BaseStyle`, is a union of these interfaces:

```
type BaseStyle = PaintStyle | TextStyle | EffectStyle | GridStyle
```

#### Base style properties

##### id: string [readonly]

The unique identifier of the style in the document the plugin is executing from. You can assign this value via `setFillStyleIdAsync`, `setStrokeStyleIdAsync`, `setTextStyleIdAsync`, etc. to make the node properties reflect that of the style node.

---

##### consumers: [StyleConsumers](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/StyleConsumers/)[] [readonly]

**DEPRECATED:** Use `getStyleConsumersAsync` instead. Accessing this property will throw an exception if the plugin manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`.

---

##### remove(): void

Deletes a local style.

---

#### Plugin data properties

#### Folders

Styles can be put inside folders (including nested folders) by setting the name of the style to be a delimited path name. For example, the following code would move a paint style named `Style 1` into a nested folder named `b`. Folder `b` resides in folder `a`.

```
const style = figma.createPaintStyle() style.name = "a/b/Style 1"
```

Folder names cannot be empty strings and they are unique within the same hierarchy. Since two nested folders can have the same name when residing in different parent folders, we refer to folders by their absolute delimited folder name. The following function `getNamePrefix` can be used to get the absolute folder name given a style name.

```
const getNameParts = (name: string) => { const nameParts = name.split('/').filter((part: string) => !!part) return nameParts.map((part: string) => part.trim())}const getNamePrefix = (name: string): string => { const pathParts = getNameParts(name) pathParts.pop() return pathParts.join('/')}

Styles can be put inside folders (including nested folders) by setting the name of the style to be a delimited path name. For example, the following code would move a paint style named `Style 1` into a nested folder named `b`. Folder `b` resides in folder `a`.

```
const style = figma.createPaintStyle() style.name = "a/b/Style 1"
```

Folder names cannot be empty strings and they are unique within the same hierarchy. Since two nested folders can have the same name when residing in different parent folders, we refer to folders by their absolute delimited folder name. The following function `getNamePrefix` can be used to get the absolute folder name given a style name.

```
const getNameParts = (name: string) => { const nameParts = name.split('/').filter((part: string) => !!part) return nameParts.map((part: string) => part.trim())}const getNamePrefix = (name: string): string => { const pathParts = getNameParts(name) pathParts.pop() return pathParts.join('/')}
```
